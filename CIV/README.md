# Collective Investment Vehicles (CIV)

This directory contains material that is based largely on concepts from the European Funds and Asset Management Association (EFAMA) and will require future refactoring to accommodate other types of funds including hedge funds, funds arrangements in other jurisdictions and other variants. Part of that work would include subdividing this content into separate modules, particularly for concepts common to all or most funds.
