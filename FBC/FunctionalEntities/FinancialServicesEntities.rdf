		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>These clearing houses are often operated by the major banks in the country. The house&apos;s prime responsibility is to provide efficiency and stability to the financial markets that they operate in.

There are two main processes that are carried out by CCPs: clearing and settlement of market transactions. Clearing relates to identifying the obligations of both parties on either side of a transaction. Settlement occurs when the final transfer of securities and funds occur.

CCPs benefit both parties in a transaction because they bear most of the credit risk. If two individuals deal with one another, the buyer bears the credit risk of the seller, and vice versa. When a CCP is used the credit risk that is held against both buyer and seller is coming from the CCP, which in all likelihood is much less than in the previous situation.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

Depository institutions accept public deposits, which are insured by the government against loss, and channel those deposits into lending activities.  Non-depository institutions, such as brokerage firms, life insurance companies, pension funds, and investment companies, fund their investment activities directly from financial markets by selling securities to the public or by selling insurance policies, in the case of insurance companies.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>In the US, insurance companies are subject to supervision by the insurance commissioner or a similar official or agency of a State; or any receiver or similar official or any liquidating agent for such a company, in his capacity as such. Common forms of insurance include life, property and casualty, and health insurance. In addition to insuring against hazards, many insurance companies also sell investments or investment-like products. The most prevalent investment products offered by insurers are annuities and life insurance policies that also feature investment elements.

A number of insurance companies operate brokerage arms that trade securities on behalf of clients.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
