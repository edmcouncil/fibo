		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>A bank, as specified in the Investment Company Act of 1940, is a financial intermediary that is (a) a depository institution (as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) or a branch or agency of a foreign bank (as such terms are defined in section 1(b) of the International Banking Act of 1978), (b) a member bank of the Federal Reserve System, (c) any other banking institution or trust company, whether incorporated or not, doing business under the laws of any State or of the United States, a substantial portion of the business of which consists of receiving deposits or exercising fiduciary powers similar to those permitted to national banks under the authority of the Comptroller of the Currency, and which is supervised and examined by State or Federal authority having supervision over banks, and which is not operated for the purpose of evading the provisions of this title, and (d) a receiver, conservator, or other liquidating agent of any institution or firm included in clause (a), (b), or (c) of this paragraph.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

A bank earns money by reinvesting these funds in longer-term assets.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>According to the FFIEC, a bank holding company is a company that owns and/or controls one or more U.S. banks or one that owns, or has controlling interest in, one or more banks.

The Board of Governors is responsible for regulating and supervising bank holding companies, even if the bank owned by the holding company is under the primary supervision of a different federal agency (OCC or FDIC).</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
