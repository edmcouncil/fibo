		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>A bank, as specified in the Investment Company Act of 1940, is a financial intermediary that is (a) a depository institution (as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) or a branch or agency of a foreign bank (as such terms are defined in section 1(b) of the International Banking Act of 1978), (b) a member bank of the Federal Reserve System, (c) any other banking institution or trust company, whether incorporated or not, doing business under the laws of any State or of the United States, a substantial portion of the business of which consists of receiving deposits or exercising fiduciary powers similar to those permitted to national banks under the authority of the Comptroller of the Currency, and which is supervised and examined by State or Federal authority having supervision over banks, and which is not operated for the purpose of evading the provisions of this title, and (d) a receiver, conservator, or other liquidating agent of any institution or firm included in clause (a), (b), or (c) of this paragraph.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 defines a bank as any depository financial intermediary that accepts checking accounts (checks) or makes commercial loans, and its deposits are insured by a federal deposit insurance agency. A bank acts as a middleman between suppliers of funds and users of funds, substituting its own credit judgement for that of the ultimate suppliers of funds, collecting those funds from three sources: checking accounts, savings and time deposits; short-term borrowings from other banks; and equity capital. A bank earns money by reinvesting these funds in longer-term assets.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

A bank holding company may also own another bank holding company, which in turn owns or controls a bank; the company at the top of the ownership chain is called the top holder. The Board of Governors is responsible for regulating and supervising bank holding companies, even if the bank owned by the holding company is under the primary supervision of a different federal agency (OCC or FDIC).</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
