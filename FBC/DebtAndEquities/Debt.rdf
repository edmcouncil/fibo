		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/20180801/DebtAndEquities/Debt/ version of this ontology was added to the FBC domain via the FIBO 2.0 RFC in support of several FIBO debt-oriented initiatives.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/20180801/DebtAndEquities/Debt/ version of this ontology was modified to use the generic statistical measures and measurements now in FND.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/20190501/DebtAndEquities/Debt/ version of this ontology was modified to add several common day count conventions used to calculate the amount of accrued interest or the present value when the next coupon payment is less than a full coupon period away, to support collateral agreements such as deeds of trust, UCC filings and the like, to add the concept of a rate reset time of day, to eliminate duplication of concepts in LCC, to simplify addresses, and to merge countries with locations.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/20200301/DebtAndEquities/Debt/ version of this ontology was modified to make redemption provision a child of contractual commitment and move it to financial instruments, as such provisions apply to preferred shares and other instruments in addition to debt.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/20200801/DebtAndEquities/Debt/ version of this ontology was modified to move the concept of an extension provision from Debt to Contracts to support representation of preferred shares and other extendable contracts, eliminate remaining circular definitions, integrate concepts defining credit facilities, and refine the concept of collateral to differentiate collateral that is real property from financial assets such as cash, various accounts, securities, and receivables.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/20210301/DebtAndEquities/Debt/ version of this ontology was modified to (1) add concepts including credit agreement whose principal is repaid at maturity and those whose principal is repaid over the course of the agreement, (2) move properties related to maturity to this ontology from FinancialInstruments and restructure the relationship between these two ontologies, (3) add the concept of a borrower identifier and the related scheme, (4) add the concept of an interest rate cap as a potential provision with respect to interest rate terms, and (5) clarified the definition of promissory note.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/20220301/DebtAndEquities/Debt/ version of this ontology was modified to add more detailed schedule information to support management of the various kinds of events that can impact a given contract as well as the concept of a revolving line of credit.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/20220601/DebtAndEquities/Debt/ version of this ontology was modified to address text formatting issues uncovered by hygiene testing.</skos:changeNote>

Among the most common conventions are 30/360 or 365, actual/360 or 365, and actual/actual. A 30/360 convention assumes 30 days in a month and 360 days in a year. An actual/360 convention assumes the actual number of days in the given month and 360 days in the year. An actual/ actual convention uses the actual number of days in the given interest period and year.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

Semantic Modeling note This term is over-ridden for specific kinds of debt (securities, loans) and is therefore not needed in any data model. It is included here to define part of the meaning of the Debt Finance term. It is a Relationship Fact and strictly speaking should be regarded as being specialized and over-ridden by the terms in the Loan and Security classes, however it is modeled here as a &quot;Referenceable Archetype&quot; meaning that it appears in diagrams as a textual entry not a relationship line, and so it is not possible to formally show this specialization.</skos:editorialNote>
