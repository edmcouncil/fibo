		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>A basket may be associated with a specific market sector, and may be delineated for the purposes of statistical analysis, such as for calculating CPI. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), with respect to the CPI, a market basket is a package of goods and services that consumers purchase for day-to-day living. The weight of each item is based on the amount of expenditure reported by a sample of households.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>From a securities perspective, a basket is a collection of products or securities that are designated to mimic the performance of a market. For investors, the market basket is the principal idea behind index funds, which are essentially a broad sample of stocks, bonds or other securities in the market; this provides investors with a benchmark against which to compare their investment returns.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>The advent of money as a medium of exchange has allowed trade to be conducted in a manner that is much simpler and effective compared to earlier forms of trade, such as bartering. In financial markets, trading also can mean performing a transaction that involves the selling and purchasing of a security.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>The seller must deliver the commodity sold to the buyer; the buyer must pay the agreed purchase price, which could be in the form of other goods or services, on the agreed date.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>Trading activities typically include (a) regularly underwriting or dealing in securities; interest rate, foreign exchange rate, commodity, equity, and credit derivative contracts; other financial instruments; and other assets for resale, (b) acquiring or taking positions in such items principally for the purpose of selling in the near term or otherwise with the intent to resell in order to profit from short-term price movements, and (c) acquiring or taking positions in such items as an accommodation to customers or for other trading purposes.
