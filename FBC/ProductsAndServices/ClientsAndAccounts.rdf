		<skos:example>For an account in Switzerland, suppose that an example domestic account number is 762 1162-3852.957. Suppose further that the bank identifier portion of that domestic account number is 762, or normalized for the BBAN is &apos;00762&apos;. For that example, the corresponding BBAN is &apos;00762011623852957&apos; and IBAN is &apos;CH9300762011623852957&apos;.</skos:example>

The check digits are calculated based on the scheme defined in ISO/IEC 7064 (MOD97-10).</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
