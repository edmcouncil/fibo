		<skos:definition>financial product that acts as a container for at least one financial instrument, including other financial products, and whose value is derived from, or based on a reference asset, market measure, or investment strategy</skos:definition>
		<skos:scopeNote>Packaged products are typically included in an institution&apos;s approved product catalog, i.e., pre-approved by compliance organizations for sale to clients. Not all institutions maintain such a catalog, with internal identifiers for such products, but many do. Such core products may have as attributes: Type (product and possibly asset class), product identifier, status and approval date, product family approval (as appropriate), and so forth.</skos:scopeNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>Certain properties of the instruments, such as their term, interest rate, eligibility of the client, etc., may be set as a part of the product specification. Some of these are intrinsic but variable properties of the instrument, for example the exact interest rate, whereas others are extrinsic, such as client eligibility. Product offerings have prices, which may build in various fees, that are components of the cost of carry on a trader&apos;s books.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>Reference assets and market measures may include single equity or debt securities, indexes, commodities, interest rates and/or foreign currencies, as well as baskets of these reference assets or market measures. Like other well-known market instruments such as convertible bonds, many structured products are hybrid securities. Structured products typically have two components - a debt instrument and a derivative, which is often an option. The debt instrument, in some instances, may pay interest at a specified rate and interval. The derivative component establishes payment at maturity, which may give the issuer the right to buy from you, or sell you, the referenced security or securities at a predetermined price. For example, structured products may combine characteristics of debt and equity or of debt and commodities.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>SEC Rule 434 defines structured securities as &apos;securities whose cash flow characteristics depend upon one or more indices or that have embedded forwards or options or securities where an investor&apos;s investment return and the issuer&apos;s payment obligations are contingent on, or highly sensitive to, changes in the value of underlying assets, indices, interest rates or cash flows&apos;.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

		<cmns-av:adaptedFrom>Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended 12 August 2012</cmns-av:adaptedFrom>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>A security can be any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap, bond, debenture,certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement or in any oil, gas, or other mineral royalty or lease, any collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange relating to foreign currency, or in general, any instrument commonly known as a security, or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing; but shall not include currency or any note, draft, bill of exchange, or bankers&apos; acceptance which has a maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months, exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which is likewise limited.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>In the U.S., the Supreme Court has adopted a flexible and liberal approach in determining what constitutes a security. In its famous decision of SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 90 L.Ed. 1244, 66 S.Ct. 1100 (1946), the Court held that land sales contracts for citrus groves in Florida, coupled with warranty deeds for the land and a contract to service the land, were &apos;investment contracts&apos; and thus securities. The Court stated that [a]n investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party. 66 S.Ct. at 1103. According to the Court, it is immaterial whether the shares in the enterprise are evidenced by formal certificates or by nominal interests in the physical assets employed in the enterprise. 66 S.Ct. at 1104.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>Some securities may be traded over the counter, or through an exchange, or via some other trading venue such as an electronic trading platform.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>Whether a contract or other economic right is a security essentially depends on whether the holder of the contract is acting as an investor who seeks financial benefits based on the work of a promoter or a third party.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">A spot transaction is a transaction in which some goods or instrument(s) are exchanged for some other goods or instruments, including currency, with no future delivery provision, i.e., within the minimum number of days possible. Examples include currency spots and commodity spot transactions, whose settlement convention is determined by the relevant market.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

For example, there is a set expiration date that exchanges will publish for exchange-traded options - in the US it is the Saturday following the third Friday of every month. Similarly, there are set incremental dates for strike for exchange traded options.

		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>The nominal amount of a financial instrument is the face amount used to calculate payments made on that instrument. This amount generally does not change.
		
		For securities the nominal value is often referred to as the face or par value. This is the redemption price of the security and is normally stated on the front of that security. With respect to bonds and stocks, it is the stated value of an issued security, as opposed to its market value.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
