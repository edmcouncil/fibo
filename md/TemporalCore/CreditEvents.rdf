However, 4 of those that are given as &quot;yes/no&quot; in FpML do in fact have the additional fact of Default Requirement. So almost none are simple yes/no or list entry terms. Modeled accordingly. Note also that the term Credit Event is defined more widely than just in CDS, for example in credit indices or just as business events generally. Therefore some of the CDS-specific terms here won&apos;t apply in those other contexts. Review comment: 22 styles of ISDA agreements for CDS as well, with different combinations of terms.

Modeling notes:
This is therefore modeled as a reference to a suitable scheme rather than to a given type of restructuring, on the assumption that the CDS Contract will be set up in this way. A more complete semantics would identify the type as a type of restructuring event and treat the scheme as ancillary, but for now we will assume that this is sufficient for the formal definition of these terms in a CDS Contract.
