		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/20180801/OwnershipAndControl/CorporateOwnership.rdf version of this ontology was modified to generalize the definition of beneficial owner rather than limiting it to shareholding and eliminate a duplicate restriction on shareholder.</skos:changeNote>

From World Bank Report: In identifying the beneficial owner, the focus should be on two factors: the control exercised and the benefit derived. Control of a corporate vehicle will always depend on context, as control can be exercised in many different ways, including through ownership, contractually or informally.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

		<rdfs:label>shareholding</rdfs:label>
		<skos:definition>Legal power of stockholders (shareholders) varies in proportion to their shareholdings. Typically, ten percent and below stockholding provides no protection. Fifteen percent stockholding may give the power to petition courts against changing the shares class rights. Up to 49.9 percent stockholding normally gives power to demand calling of an extraordinary general meeting. Fifty percent and over stockholding gives power to fire a director and force out minority stockholders by acquiring their shares as per the rules of the firm. Holder of 75 percent of the stock has the power to change the articles and memorandum of association and the firms name, reduce the share capital, allow the firm to buy its own shares from other stockholders, and to shut down the business. One hundred percent stockholding of course gives total power under the corporate legislation.</skos:definition>
