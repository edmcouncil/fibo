		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/20131101/OwnershipAndControl/CorporateOwnership.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO BE 1.0 FTF report.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/20160201/OwnershipAndControl/CorporateOwnership.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the FIBO 2.0 RFC to reference shareholders&apos; equity in the definition of a shareholder.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/20180801/OwnershipAndControl/CorporateOwnership.rdf version of this ontology was modified to generalize the definition of beneficial owner rather than limiting it to shareholding and eliminate a duplicate restriction on shareholder.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/20190201/OwnershipAndControl/CorporateOwnership.rdf version of this ontology was modified to modify the inheritance hierarchy for beneficial owner to replace owner with controlling party as one of its parent classes.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/20200601/OwnershipAndControl/CorporateOwnership.rdf version of this ontology was modified to replace isEquityHeldBy with its parent, isHeldBy, eliminate redundant classes that were not used anywhere, and clean up a few definitions to be less ambiguous, not circular, and to conform with ISO 704.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/20200901/OwnershipAndControl/CorporateOwnership.rdf version of this ontology was revised to simplify the contract party hierarchy.</skos:changeNote>

		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>The legal power of a shareholder varies in proportion to their shareholding. Typically, ten percent and below stockholding provides no protection. Fifteen percent stockholding may give the power to petition courts against changing the shares class rights. Up to 49.9 percent stockholding normally gives power to demand calling of an extraordinary general meeting. Fifty percent and over stockholding gives power to fire a director and force out minority stockholders by acquiring their shares as per the rules of the firm. Holder of 75 percent of the stock has the power to change the articles and memorandum of association and the firms name, reduce the share capital, allow the firm to buy its own shares from other stockholders, and to shut down the business. One hundred percent stockholding of course gives total power under the corporate legislation.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
