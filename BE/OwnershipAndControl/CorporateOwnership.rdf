		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>From World Bank Report: In identifying the beneficial owner, the focus should be on two factors: the control exercised and the benefit derived. Control of a corporate vehicle will always depend on context, as control can be exercised in many different ways, including through ownership, contractually or informally.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) refers to a &apos;beneficial owner&apos; as the natural person(s) who ultimately owns or controls a legal entity and/or the natural person on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted. It also includes those persons who exercise ultimate effective control over a legal person or arrangement.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) defines a &apos;beneficial owner&apos; as (1) a single individual with significant responsibility to control, manage or direct a legal entity customer, or (2) each individual, if any, who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, owns 25 percent or more of the equity interests of a legal entity customer; if a trust owns directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, 25 percent or more of the equity interests of a legal entity customer, the beneficial owner is the trustee.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>Use of a nominee (who may be an agent, custodian, or a trustee) does not change the position regarding tax reporting and tax liability, and the beneficial owner remains responsible.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>The legal power of a shareholder varies in proportion to their shareholding. Typically, ten percent and below stockholding provides no protection. Fifteen percent stockholding may give the power to petition courts against changing the shares class rights. Up to 49.9 percent stockholding normally gives power to demand calling of an extraordinary general meeting. Fifty percent and over stockholding gives power to fire a director and force out minority stockholders by acquiring their shares as per the rules of the firm. Holder of 75 percent of the stock has the power to change the articles and memorandum of association and the firms name, reduce the share capital, allow the firm to buy its own shares from other stockholders, and to shut down the business. One hundred percent stockholding of course gives total power under the corporate legislation.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
