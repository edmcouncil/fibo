		<rdfs:label>Ownership Parties Ontology</rdfs:label>
		<dct:abstract>This ontology defines concepts relating to types of organization owning parties. The concepts defined here are party in role concepts, which define the nature of some entity such as an organization or a legal person, in some role such as that of owning equity in the entity. These roles are defined in terms of the ownership enjoyed by the party, with distinctions between constitutional ownership i.e. ownership defined in terms of stockholder equity, and investment ownership more generally.</dct:abstract>
