		<rdfs:label>Functional Entities Ontology</rdfs:label>
		<dct:abstract>This ontology defines the fundamental concepts for entities defined by their function, such as the relationship to the various forms which one or another functionally-defined entity may take. It also includes a number of basic types of entity defined by function, such as business and non-profit. The concepts in this ontology are intended to be extensible in other ontologies which may be dedicated to specific kinds of functionally-defined business entity or organization.</dct:abstract>

		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/20131101/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO BE 1.0 FTF report.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/20150201/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO BE 1.1 RTF report. Changes include deprecation of the SoleProprietorship class and making it equivalent to the class with the same name in the Sole Proprietorships ontology. This version also introduces a new FunctionalEntity class, as the parent of FunctionalBusinessEntity in this ontology and as the parent of Government in the GovernmentEntities ontology.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/20160801/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was modified by the FIBO 2.0 revision to address missing labels and definitions on the deprecated sole proprietorship class to match those in the equivalent class.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/20180801/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to generalize certain unions where they were no longer required and eliminate an unused import.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/20190201/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to eliminate deprecated elements.</skos:changeNote>

		<rdfs:label>business</rdfs:label>
		<skos:definition>An organization or economic system where goods and services are exchanged for one another or for money. Every business requires some form of investment and enough customers to whom its output can be sold on a consistent basis in order to make a profit. Businesses can be privately owned, not-for-profit or state-owned. An example of a corporate business is PepsiCo, while a mom-and-pop catering business is a private enterprise.</skos:definition>

This would define for example a bank, a special purpose vehicle, most government bodies and so on.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
