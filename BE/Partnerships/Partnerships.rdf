Included are abstract definitions of partnership types based on whether they have general, limited or both kinds of partners.

		<cmns-av:abbreviation>LLLP</cmns-av:abbreviation>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>The primary difference between an LLLP and more traditional limited partnership is that an LLLP allows liability transfer from the general partner&apos;s (to external insurer) for debts and obligations of the limited partnership.

		<rdfs:label>limited partnership</rdfs:label>
		<skos:definition>partnership that has at least one general partner and at least one limited partner</skos:definition>
		<skos:example>In the United States, film production companies, real estate investment firms, and private equity firms are typically formed as limited partnerships. In the United Kingdom, limited partnerships are governed by the Limited Partnerships Act 1907 and, on matters on which that Act is silent, also by the Partnership Act 1890.</skos:example>
		<cmns-av:abbreviation>LP</cmns-av:abbreviation>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>Limited partnerships are distinct from limited liability partnerships, in which all partners have limited liability. Similar to a general partnership, the general partners have management control, share the right to use partnership property, share the profits of the firm in predefined proportions, and have joint and several liability for the debts of the partnership.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
