    <h1>EDM Council FIBO Linked Data Fragments</h1>
    <p>
      To increase the availability of FIBO triples from our Linked Data
      Fragment server are
      available <a href="http://fragments.edmcouncil.org/">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A linked data fragment client can be pointed to that location.
      Linked Data Fragment client and server
      implementation are available <a href="http://linkeddatafragments.org/">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this server is to make FIBO available to intelligent clients that
      can process triples in client-side SPARQL. A triple pattern
      specification is very lightweight, and still allows SPARQL
      endpoint-like access to data. One can look at this protocol
      method as sitting between a full RDF dump file and a SPARQL
      endpoint. We
      plann to offer client implementation from this server after
      some further testing and finding some handy queries to
      prepopulate.  Other fragments servers in production can be
      found <a href="http://data.linkeddatafragments.org/">here</a>.
