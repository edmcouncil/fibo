    <h2>Products</h2>
    <p>
Today, FIBO is available as the four  products below, with more soon to follow.  All FIBO products are generated or derived from the W3C OWL System of Record.  FND, FBC, IND, and BE have been vetted and tested and are OMG specs. SEC, DER and LOANS are Beta.  All others are Alpha or less, and should not be relied upon except as raw material. Be aware that flaws in the OWL will be reflected in all other products.  We are making all of FIBO available now because we have already seen amazing work done with FIBO as raw material and we welcome, almost demand - your feedback. <a href="mailto:dwisnosky@edmcouncil.org">dwisnosky@edmcouncil.org</a>.

<h2>Using FIBO</h2>

<p>


<ul>
<li>FIBO Vocabulary - A machine-readable dictionary of terms in FIBO (in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a>)</li>
<li>FIBO Glossary - A human-readable, cross-referenced dictionary of terms in FIBO (in HTML)</li>
<li>FIBO Models - Machine- and human-readable UML diagrams of FIBO (using <a href="">SMIF</a></li>
<li>schema.org - A vocabulary for marking up web pages with terms taken from FIBO</li>
</ul>

The FIBO Ontology is available online using the <a href="http://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/follow-your-nose.html"><i>follow-your-nose</i></a> pattern.  This means that tools that use this pattern can read FIBO directly from the web.  This ensures that you are always viewing the latest version of FIBO.  Keep in mind, that when viewing FIBO in this way, that any edits you make to FIBO will only be reflected in your own copy, and won't be saved for others to see. 

FIBO is also available for offline use by downloading a .zip of the current state.  FIBO is updated every three months, so any such offline downloaded version will quickly be out of date.  

FIBO is published using the Web Ontology Language (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-primer/">OWL</a>).  There are a number of tools available, both commercial and open source, that can read and edit FIBO.  We provide instructions for the most common ones.  

<h3>Using FIBO online</h3>


<h4>Protégé</h4>
<a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/">Protégé</a> is an open-source ontology editor that can be used to view and edit FIBO.  Protégé works well in online mode, so you can point it to the AboutFIBO file, and it will load the rest. 
<ol>
<li>In Protégé, select File>Open from URL</li>
<li>Paste in the URL for the AboutFIBO.rdf file from the version you desire; <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/master/latest/AboutFIBO.rdf">alpha</a> version or the <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/pink/latest/AboutFIBO.rdf">release</a></li>
</ol>
Protégé will find and load all the FIBO files from the currently published version (for the selected version). 
<h4>TopBraid Composer</h4>
At the moment, FIBO cannot be loaded online into TopBraid Composer. 


<h4>No Magic CCM Cameo Concept Modeler</h4>
 
<a href="https://www.nomagic.com/product-addons/magicdraw-addons/cameo-concept-modeler-plugin">CCM (Cameo Concept Modeler)</a> imports both the RDF/XML and Turtle TTL formats,  and pulls the ontology into a 'UML-like' model of the ontology, which is then ready to use.

<ol>
<li>Download a zipped file of FIBO in RDF/XML format from spec.edmcouncil.org . You'll need to specify which maturity level of FIBO you want; the alpha version or the release version.</li>
<li>Unzip this to your hard drive. This creates a single directory called fibo, with all of the FIBO ontologies in subdirectories.</li>
<li>Open MagicDraw with the CCM plugin installed. </li>
<li>In MagicDraw, create a new project:  File/New Project/  and name it.</li>
<li>Import the FIBO Master:  File/Import From/OWL Ontology File,  and navigate to the folder where you unzipped FIBO. Navigate to AboutFIBO.rdf, or AboutFIBO.ttl, depending on your preference, and import it.</li>
MagicDraw will import all of FIBO ontologies contained in the AboutFIBO file.
</ol>




<h3>Using FIBO offline</h3>
<h4>Protégé</h4>
Protégé prefers to manage files in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/">RDF/XML</a> format.  Follow these instructions to download a zip file of FIBO in RDF/XML and load it into Protégé. 
<ol>
<li>Download a zipped file of FIBO in RDF/XML format from spec.edmcouncil.org. You'll need to specify which maturity level of FIBO you want; the <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/master/latest/latest.rdf.zip">alpha</a> version or the <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/pink/latest/latest.rdf.zip">release</a> version. </li>
<li>Unzip this to your hard drive.  This creates a single directory called <i>fibo</i>, with all of the FIBO ontologies in subdirectories. </li>
<li>Open Protégé.  Due to technical issues with how FIBO imports ontologies, you must use Protégé version 5.0 or higher. </li>
<li>Select File>Open, and navigate to the folder where you unzipped FIBO.  Navigte to AboutFIBO.rdf, and select it. </li
<li>Protege will open all relevant FIBO files. </li>
</ol>
<h4><a href="http://www.topquadrant.com/tools/IDE-topbraid-composer-maestro-edition/">TopBraid Composer</a></h4>
TopBraid Composer prefers to manage files in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">RDF Turtle</a> format.  Follow these instructions to download a zip file of FIBO in Turtle and load it into TopBraid:

<ol>
<li>Download a zipped file of FIBO in Turtle from spec.edmcouncil.org.  You'll need to specify which maturity level of FIBO you want; the <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/master/latest/latest.ttl.zip">alpha</a> version or the <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/pink/latest/latest.ttl.zip">release</a> version. </li>
<li>Unzip this on your hard drive.  This creates a single directory called <i>fibo</i>, with all of the FIBO ontologies in subdirectories. </li>
<li>Open TopBraid Composer.  Create a project (File>New>Project) called <i>spec.edmcouncil.org</i>.</li>  
<li>Drag and drop the <i>fibo</i> directory from your filesystem onto the project <i>spec.edmcouncil.org</i> in the TopBraid Composer Navigator pane.  If prompted, select "Copy files"</li>
<li>Navigate through the fibo directory in the Navigator pane until you find AboutFIBO.ttl (it is in the directory fibo/ontology/master/latest for the latest alpha, and in fibo/ontology/release/latest for the release version.  Double-click on AboutFIBO.ttl to open all FIBO files. 
</ol>


<b>Note:</b> FIBO makes reference to <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/LCC/">LCC (Languages, Countries and Codes)</a> from the OMG, which includes information about these things from other standards bodies.  When you load FIBO, both Protege and TopBraid Composer will find these files via follow-your-nose.  If your network does no allow you to reach the omg.org web servers, you will see load errors for the files it couldn't find.
