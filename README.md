FIBO is hosted and sponsored by the [Enterprise Data Management Council (EDM Council)](https://edmcouncil.org). 

FIBO is a trademark of EDM Council, Inc. It is also standardized by the [Object Management Group](https://www.omg.org/index.htm).

# Introduction

FIBO defines the sets of things that are of interest in financial business applications and the ways that those things can relate to one another. In this way, FIBO can give meaning to any data (e.g., spreadsheets, relational databases, XML documents) that describe the business of finance. 

FIBO is developed as an ontology in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). The language is codified by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), and it is based on Description Logic. The use of logic ensures that each FIBO concept is framed in a way that is unambiguous and that is readable both by humans and machines.

FIBO is published in a number of formats for operating use and business definitions. 

FIBO concepts have been reviewed by [EDMC member firms](https://edmcouncil.org/page/listofmembersreview) over the years and represent a consensus of the common concepts as understood in the industry and as reflected in industry data models and message standards. 


# Mission
Since January 2020, FIBO has been developed by an **open community process** with a mission to develop, maintain, and promote global platform-independent, machine-readable and unambiguous data standard that enables understanding of the financial terminology, cross-system federation and aggregation of data to improve effectiveness of decisions, to improve efficiency in regulatory reporting and to fast-track the adoption of advanced analytical capabilities for financial services.

### Community Discussion

Our preferred method for discussing topics unrelated to specific issues, pull requests, wiki pages or artifacts is [Slack](https://slack.com).
Please join the *Slack workspace* [fibo-edmc.slack.com](https://fibo-edmc.slack.com) by sending an email with your information to fibo@edmcouncil.org, we will then send you a link (by email) that gets you in.

A *Slack workspace* is a shared hub made up of channels where team members can communicate and work together. When you join a workspace, you need to create a Slack account using your email address.

A *Slack workspace* consists of *channels* (like [#general](https://fibo-edmc.slack.com/archives/CF2C7EZKN) or [#fibo-user-group](https://fibo-edmc.slack.com/archives/CFH3QDUMC)) that can be either public or private. Most channels are public and as user you can select the channels that you wish to use. For private channels you would need to be invited by the owner of that channel.

# Directories

Directory                | Description | Browse in FIBO Viewer |
:----------------------- |:------- |:-----------|
[BE](./BE/)    | This directory contains ontologies belonging to the FIBO Business Entities (BE) Domain. This domain defines business concepts that are used for data governance, interoperability, and in regulatory reporting about business entities. | click [here](https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/MetadataBE/BEDomain) to browse BE in FIBO Viewer |
[BP](./BP/)    | This directory contains ontologies belonging to the Business Process (BP) domain. This domain includes ontologies that define financial process flows, such as securities issuance and transaction workflows. In the case of securities issuance process models, these are provided in order to be able to represent reference data concepts that are dependent on the process by which a security was issued. Transaction process semantics provide the basis for the temporal dimension of securities and derivatives transactions. | click [here](https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BP/MetadataBP/BPDomain) to browse BP in FIBO Viewer |
[CAE](./CAE/)  | This directory contains ontologies belonging to the Corporate Actions and Events (CAE) domain. This domain contains ontologies that define events and actions that may occur during the life of a security, and are typically those events which may cause some change in some part of the underlying reference information for that security. Corporate actions include actions that require some action on the part of the holder, and in these and some other cases, there are process descriptions for the flow of activities involved. | click [here](https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/CAE/MetadataCAE/CAEDomain) to browse CAE in FIBO Viewer |
[CIV](./CIV/)  | This directory contains ontologies belonging to the Collective Investment Vehicles (CIV) domain.  This domain contains ontologies that define terms for investment funds, covering the basic definition of a fund, the various fund related parties, portfolio characteristics and tradable units in those funds. | click [here](https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/CIV/MetadataCIV/CIVDomain) to browse CIV in FIBO Viewer |
[DER](./DER/)  | This directory contains ontologies belonging to the Derivatives (DER) Domain. This domain covers many of the concepts that are common to derivative instruments, including but not limited to options, futures, forwards, swaps, and a wide range of other derivatives. | click [here](https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/MetadataDER/DERDomain) to browse DER in FIBO Viewer |
[FBC](./FBC/)  | This directory contains ontologies belonging to the Financial Business and Commerce domain. This domain covers business concepts that are common to a number of finance areas, such as loans, securities, and corporate actions, including products and services, financial intermediaries, registrars and regulators, and financial instruments and products.  | click [here](https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/MetadataFBC/FBCDomain) to browse FBC in FIBO Viewer |
[FND](./FND/)  | This directory contains ontologies belonging to the Foundations (FND) domain. This domain includes ontologies that define general-purpose concepts required to support other FIBO domains. These include concepts and relationships about people, organizations, places, and most importantly, contracts that are essential to domains such as Business Entities (BE), Financial Business and Commerce (FBC), Indices and Indicators (IND), and Securities (SEC). | click [here](https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/MetadataFND/FNDDomain) to browse FBC in FIBO Viewer |
[IND](./IND/)  | This directory contains ontologies belonging to the FIBO Indices and Indicators (IND) Domain. This domain covers market indices and reference rates, including economic indicators, foreign exchange, interest rates, and other benchmarks. The ontologies cover quoted interest rates, economic measures such as employment rates, and quoted indices required to support baskets of securities, including specific kinds of securities in share indices or bond indices, as well as credit indices. | click [here](https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/IND/MetadataIND/INDDomain) to browse FBC in FIBO Viewer |
[LOAN](./LOAN/)| This directory contains ontologies belonging to the FIBO Loan (LOAN) domain. This domain provides a model of concepts that are common to loan contracts in various market categories including but not limited to commercial, small business, automobile, education, and mortgage. High-level concepts relevant to loan contracts include the obligations of parties playing different roles, credit and risk, security agreements as well as additional detail for HMDA-specific loans. Details defining debt instruments, in general, are covered in a separate debt module in the Securities domain. | click [here](https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/LOAN/MetadataLOAN/LOANDomain) to browse LOAN in FIBO Viewer |
[MD](./MD/)    | This directory contains ontologies belonging to the Market Data (MD) domain. This domain contains ontologies that represent temporally variant concepts for the whole range of financial instruments, loans, and funds. While all concepts can be regarded as having some relationship to time, the ones in this domain are those concepts that explicitly have a set of past values a present value and projected future values. As such, this domain covers the concepts represented in market data, such as prices, yields, and analytics for debt and for pools of assets. | click [here](https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/MD/MetadataMD/MDDomain) to browse MD in FIBO Viewer |
[SEC](./SEC/)  | This directory contains ontologies belonging to the FIBO Securities (SEC) domain. This domain provides a model of concepts that are common to financial instruments that are also securities, including but not limited to exchange-traded securities. High-level concepts relevant to securities classification, identification, issuance, and registration of securities generally are covered, as well as additional detail for equities and debt instruments. More details defining derivatives, in particular, are covered in a separate derivatives domain area. | click [here](https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/MetadataSEC/SECDomain) to browse SEC in FIBO Viewer |
