README

This archive contains two separate compressed sets of Cameo project files:

FND
FND-STUB

These represent the following namespaces respectively:

FND: 		http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/
FND-STUB: 	http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND-STUB/

The Cameo/VOM project files under the FND namespace represent the substantive and normative content of the specification, as reflected in the OWL files and other machine readable files. 

The corresponding Cameo/VOM project files in the FND-STUB namespace reflect additional naming and labeling of certain model constructs for the purposes of creating the diagrams in the specification only. Each of the individual ontologies represented by the project files in the FND-STUB namespace imports and / or references other ontologies in the FND namespace only. That is, these FND-STuB projects do not represent a separate stand-alone set of ontologies, and are intended for use only in the production of diagrams and tables with this additional annotation content. 

The additional material in the FND-STUB namespace consists of the following:

1. Names allocated to each of the relationships associated with each OWL Restriction class. These give business-facing meaning to the implications of these relationships, and are visible in the diagrams in Section 10;

2. Names allocated to each of the OWL Restriction classes

3. Labels allocated to each of the OWL Restriction classes

4. Names allocated to each of the OWL Union classes

5. Labels allocated to each of the OWL Union classes

The names and labels are reported in the tabular reports in the specification (section 10), and are provided in order to be able to identify each class which is an annymous class in OWL.
