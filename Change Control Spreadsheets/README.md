is deprecated, as this has now been incorporated into a worksheet in the main working spreadsheet for change control, called Issues in FND and BE

# Sheet Issues in FND and BE.xlsx

The main spreadsheet change control tracking across the FIBO Family. Contains the following types of information: 

1. Analysis of prior sources of change information both for Foundations and for Business Entities, tracking how these are disposed either by raising JIRA issues or by other means (e.g. already fixed, not an issue etc.)

A similar worksheet will need to be created for Indices and Indicators. note that no public issues have been filed as of the Aug 18 deadline, that I can find (MGB). 

2. Definitive list of JIRA issues for FIBO Foundations

A similar worksheet will be needed for each FTF

3. Detailed Issue Resolution material. 

The issues resolution material is in one of two general formats, depending if this issue relates to metadata only or describes a subatantive model change. These sheets describe both the changes to be made in the VOM source models and the formal "Issues Resolution" textual material to be filed as the Issue Resolution in JIRA. Screenshots of diagrams are included to assist in their identification in the set of diagrams which have been uploaded to JIRA. 

There are some additional worksheets for cross referencing and so on.
