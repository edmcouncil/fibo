        <rdfs:label>articles of incorporation</rdfs:label>
        <skos:definition>The Articles of Association are a contract between the members and the organization, and among the members themselves, setting out the rights and duties of directors and stockholders individually and in meetings. Editorial Note: New definition and term (added in Executives) arrived at during OMG OWL migration process. Known then as &quot;Incorporated Company Legal form Documentation&quot; (seeking a jurisdiction neutral label). Original working definition: &quot;The articles of association which are defined when a registered company (specifically a company limited by the issue of shares) is set up. &quot; Explanatory Note: In some (or all?) Jurisdictions the articles in the company constitution become terms of the contract which is a share in that company. Example: In the UK: Memorandum and Articles of Association make up the Constitution. Bits of that are defined by law. In Delaware you have to have 3 officers which may be the same individual. Other states they must be separate individuals. Also in Delaware they need not be American citizens, in other states they must. Minimum requirements to be met. Also this may change as law changes. See also Anti ML and KYC stuff. Schools - governing bodies, their constitutions. Trusts.</skos:definition>
