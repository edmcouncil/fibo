		<dct:abstract>This ontology is the top-level, and most fundamental ontology for the LOAN module, extending the Debt ontology to define concepts common to all loans. It includes the primary obligations to fund the loan and to pay it back according to payment schedules. Kinds of loans covered in this ontology include open and closed end, secured and unsecured.</dct:abstract>

		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>The asset may still be subject to government regulations such as property taxes, and the owner can place voluntary encumbrances on the real estate including its use as collateral for a loan. In the case of a mortgage, fee simple can be contrasted with lease ownership, in which case the owners have complete access to the land, but they do not own it. Owners of single-family residences typically have fee simple ownership, but condo and many townhouse owners do not, as they own their individual unit but not the land on which the development is built.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
