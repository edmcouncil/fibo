		<skos:editorialNote
			xml:lang="en">The defining fact is that it is a set of sequential options. So in principal this is a strip of any kind of option. Can you strip forwards? In principal, but usually you would have a Commodity Swap which would be a strip of Forwards. Other strips? Don&apos;t always buy a string of caplets and floorlets but buy an individual cap or floor. for IR Options These are always Caps or Floors, that is the option settlement takes the form of the difference between the Strike rate and the designated underlying (observable) rate on the stated dates. Review notes: caps and floors are always strips, but there are strips for other assets as well. SO: There are strips besides Options; There are Option Strips besides IR (Cap and Floor) ones. See eg. in France where you may have a strip of options where the strike is set at each rollover. Details to come by email. In this case it would be an asset option, specifically Equity.</skos:editorialNote>
