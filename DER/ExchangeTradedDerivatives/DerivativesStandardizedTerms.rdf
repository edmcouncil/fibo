In this sense this is not the same as an Equity listing, and the facts about equities ot other exchange traded products listings do not apply to a derivatives listing. Update 24 Nov 2010: Later reviews (see notes elsewhere) don&apos;t support this description. In fact the contract is between investors (participants in the exchange).</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
