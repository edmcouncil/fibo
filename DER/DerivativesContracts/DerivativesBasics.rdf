		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20180801/DerivativesContracts/DerivativesBasics.rdf version of this ontology was modified to eliminate duplication with concepts in LCC and eliminate a redundant subclass declaration in observable value.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20200401/DerivativesContracts/DerivativesBasics.rdf version of this ontology was modified to loosen the domain of the hasUnderlier property, which could be either an instrument or leg, refine the definition of Underlier and hasUnderlier based on recent work on swaps, add the definition of a contract for difference (CFD), simplify the contract party hierarchy where the subclasses of contract party do not add semantics, add the concepts of underlying asset valuation and calculation agent, which are needed for various derivatives (moved from forwards) and eliminate the language related to transactions as well as the distinction between an OTC contract and exchange-traded contract / listed security, given how blurry the lines are today, across derivatives.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20201201/DerivativesContracts/DerivativesBasics.rdf version of this ontology was modified to eliminate hasThirdParty as a superproperty of hasCalculationAgent, which led to unintended reasoning consequences, added concepts and properties specific to settlement and valuation required for futures, forwards, and options, and moved general properties from forwards and swaps up to derivatives basics.</skos:changeNote>

		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20210801/DerivativesContracts/DerivativesBasics.rdf version of this ontology was modified to address text formatting issues identified via hygiene testing.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20220801/DerivativesContracts/DerivativesBasics.rdf version of this ontology was modified to add the concept of a credit derivative, modify the notion of an underlying asset valuation to be a kind of value assessment, and modify the concept of valuation terms to be a subclass of derivative terms.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20221001/DerivativesContracts/DerivativesBasics.rdf version of this ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) Annotation Vocabulary rather than the OMG&apos;s Specification Metadata vocabulary, and to move the definition of an underlier and the related property, has underlier, to financial instruments so that these concepts are also available for use in relation to pool-backed securities.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20230201/DerivativesContracts/DerivativesBasics.rdf version of this ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) rather than the OMG&apos;s Languages, Countries and Codes (LCC), eliminating redundancies in FIBO as appropriate.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20230301/DerivativesContracts/DerivativesBasics.rdf version of the ontology was modified to eliminate deprecations that are more than 6 months old.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20231101/DerivativesContracts/DerivativesBasics.rdf version of this ontology was modified to extend the definition of has notional amount, covering the variations allowed by the ISO CFI standard (DER-127) and to replace content that is now available in the OMG Commons Ontology Library (Commons) v1.1 (FND-380).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20231201/DerivativesContracts/DerivativesBasics.rdf version of this ontology was modified to replace additional content that is now available in the OMG Commons Ontology Library (Commons) v1.1 (FND-380) and to eliminate a redundant restriction on derivative instrument (GitHub-2028).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20240901/DerivativesContracts/DerivativesBasics.rdf version of this ontology was modified to support details of ISO 4914, Financial services - Unique Product Identifier (UPI), (DER-146), and refine definitions related to underliers (DER-112).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20250201/DerivativesContracts/DerivativesBasics.rdf version of the ontology was modified to replace additional content that is now available in the OMG Commons Ontology Library (Commons) v1.2 (FND-389).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20250301/DerivativesContracts/DerivativesBasics.rdf version of this ontology was modified to further simplify and clarify definitions related to rate derivatives (DER-90).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20250401/DerivativesContracts/DerivativesBasics.rdf version of this ontology was modified to move calculation agent up to financial instruments (DER-55) and to eliminate certain constructs that are redundant and will never be materialized to reduce the number of nodes required for various contract-related constructs (FND-391).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20250501/DerivativesContracts/RightsAndWarrants.rdf version of the ontology was modified to move a number of properties that appear to be needed on several kinds of derivatives to this ontology for better reusability (DER-151).</skos:changeNote>

These are defined in swap transaction messages and represent the terms of the contract implied by that transaction. Options (Nordea reviews): Cashflows are defined as Payouts. This is not the same as a model of a cashflow which is a consequence of applying some legal term for payment of interest or principal, but is a commitment expressed in purely cashflow terms. Review this though. Payout terms include: Values - values can only go up or down; Static values are defined for limits and the like. i.e. Constraints (and direction) - this covers caps and floors - these are read upward or downward Conditionality Formula relations (Input and Output): - these are values - these may have a cap or a floor on them also - these also may have Multiplication - there is also fixed margin - may have addition or substraction between these Linearity in covered in the above Timing / expiry Observaton (not terms): Probability Sensitivity</skos:editorialNote>

		<skos:definition xml:lang="en">cash-settled derivative where the parties agree to exchange on the maturity of the contract the difference between the current value of the underlying asset and the initial value of that asset when the contract is initiated</skos:definition>
		<skos:example xml:lang="en">For example, suppose the initial price of share XYZ is $100 and a CFD for 1000 shares is exchanged. Both the buyer and seller must post some margin. If the price goes to $105, then the buyer gets $5,000 from the seller. If the price goes to $95, the buyer pays the seller $5,000. This contract avoids ownership of the stock and all the associated transactions issues (like stamp taxes). The contract also allows for leverage (typically 10:1) because the margin that must be posted is only a fraction of the value of the underlying asset.</skos:example>
