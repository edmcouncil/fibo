		<dct:abstract>Participation notes, in the sense modeled here, are debt instruments issued in some jurisdiction, to give eligible investors the ability to participate in the returns of a debt instrument issued in another jurisdiction, to which they would not have access for regulatory or other reasons. 
		Note that this is not the same thing as a Loan Participation Note.</dct:abstract>

		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">Typically P-Notes are SPVs that are created to allow participation from outside that market. The SPV purchases a security on shore and issues a note that represents that security to offshore investors. Similar to an ADR but is always a debt security. All underlying securities come from another market from the one where the PN is issued.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
