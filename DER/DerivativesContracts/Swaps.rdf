		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20180801/DerivativesContracts/Swaps/ version of this ontology was modified to refine the concept of a unique swap identifier (USI).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20190201/DerivativesContracts/Swaps/ version of this ontology was modified to eliminate duplication of concepts in LCC.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20200201/DerivativesContracts/Swaps/ version of this ontology was modified to eliminate the property &apos;hasPaymentSchedule&apos; from this ontology in favor of the equivalent property with the same name from FND, adding concepts related to statistical swaps, and revising definitions to be ISO 704 compliant.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20200901/DerivativesContracts/Swaps/ version of this ontology was modified to integrate return swaps and connect swap legs to the swap they comprise, as appropriate, simplify the contract party hierarchy, add basic fixed and floating legs as higher level concepts common to many swaps, and eliminate ambiguity in definitions.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20201201/DerivativesContracts/Swaps/ version of this ontology was modified to move the property &apos;exchanges&apos; to FND given that it could be applied more generally than with respect to swaps only, facilitate the elimination of the property &apos;mayBeTradedIn&apos;, which was only used in one place and was redundant with the concept of a ListedSecurity / Listing in SEC, and move two properties, hasPayingParty and hasReceivingParty to DerivativesBasics to facilitate wider use.</skos:changeNote>

		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20210701/DerivativesContracts/Swaps/ version of this ontology was modified to add the concept of a rates swap and the corresponding rate-based leg to facilitate mapping to the CFI standard.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20220201/DerivativesContracts/Swaps/ version of this ontology was modified to address text formatting issues identified through hygiene testing.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20220801/DerivativesContracts/Swaps/ version of this ontology was modified to make a total return swap a kind of credit derivative.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20221001/DerivativesContracts/Swaps.rdf version of this ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) Annotation Vocabulary rather than the OMG&apos;s Specification Metadata vocabulary, to move the definition of an underlier and the related property, has underlier, to financial instruments so that these concepts are also available for use in relation to pool-backed securities.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20230301/DerivativesContracts/Swaps.rdf version of the ontology was modified to tease out the distinction between the nominal and notional amount, which were confused and augment the definition of notional for swaps to properly reflect variations from the CFI (DER-127), and replace concepts from several FIBO FND ontologies with their counterparts added to the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) v1.1 (FND-380).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20231201/DerivativesContracts/Swaps.rdf version of the ontology was modified to replace additional concepts from several FIBO FND ontologies with their counterparts added to the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) v1.1 (FND-380) and to revise definitions related to swap leg-specific events (FBC-317).</skos:changeNote>

		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>A basis swap can have two legs of the same tenor but different indices, e.g., 3 month LIBOR vs. 3 month TIBOR. The difference in this case is not driven by different interest rate periods but from different markets, i.e., the difference in efficiency between the two markets. The objective is to hedge against basis risk which is the difference in price between two markets. See also forward swap, as a means for controlling interest rate.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
