		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>A basis swap can have two legs of the same tenor but different indices, e.g., 3 month LIBOR vs. 3 month TIBOR. The difference in this case is not driven by different interest rate periods but from different markets, i.e., the difference in efficiency between the two markets. The objective is to hedge against basis risk which is the difference in price between two markets. See also forward swap, as a means for controlling interest rate.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>Each product that can act as the underlier on which the correlation is based has periodically observable prices, such as a commodity, exchange rate, interest rate, or stock index.

If the level of the index increases, the buyer of the swap will be entitled to a payment based on this performance, as such payment may be reduced (or negated) by the fee paid to the seller of the swap.
