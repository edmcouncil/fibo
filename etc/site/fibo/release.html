<h3>Release Notes:  </h3>


<b>2019 Q2</b>
      <p>Summary: This quarter was focused mainly on bug fixing and clean up activities in preparation for the release of Bonds and possibly some of the loan-specific content in Q3.  In addition to all of the clean-up work, there were two ontologies added this quarter to Foundations to facilitate representation of credit ratings and indices (planned for release later this year).</p>
      
    <p><i>Full change record</i></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Business Entities</p>
	<p><i>Highlights</i></p>
	<p>This quarter’s BE updates were primarily
	  <ol><li>migrate remaining, relevant content that was originally in informative BE ontologies to various other ontologies (and thus eliminate the remaining obsolete informative ontologies), and </li>
<li>fix reasoning errors related to government entities.</li></ol>
</p>

	<p>Detailed Changes:</p>
	<ul>
<li>BE-202  - eliminated references to BE/FunctionalEntitiesExt ontologies now that their contents have been merged into other ontologies as appropriate</li>
<li>    BE-202  - integrated content from informative ontologies in BE/FunctionalEntitiesExt into the ontologies where those concepts were used</li>
<li>    BE-203  - eliminated reasoning error which was caused by two separate but somewhat related issues: (1) an extra blank node in a reasoning loop for definining a government minister in unnecessary restrictions and (2) the fact that there were two ways to get to the same individual defining the legal entity for the government body, which is fine, but there were two tags on it as a result, and hasTag was incorrectly defined as being functional.  If you can get to an individual that has a tag in more than one way, it can't be functional.  And, anything that can be identified by more than one identifier could inadvertently also run into this problem. (#727)</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
  
      
      <li><p>Financial Business and Commerce</p>
	<p><i>Highlights</i></p>
	Updates to FBC this quarter included
<ul>
	<li>adding the concept of an exempt security in support of ongoing work in SEC/Debt,</li>
	<li>moving certain individuals around to improve modularity and reasoning performance, and</li>
	<li>cleaning up the logic related to baskets and registries as indicated through additional testing.	</li></ul>

	<p>Detailed Changes:</p>
	<ul>
<li>FBC-103  - added the definition of exempt security, which is required for some of the definitions in the bonds and traded short-term debt ontologies, to financial instruments and made a registered security disjoint with exempt security (#717)</li>
<li>FBC-221  - addressed feedback received in GitHub comments</li>
<li>FBC-221  - fixed hygiene errors</li>
<li>FBC-221  - moved certain registration authority individuals from primary business registries and markets ontologies to a new international individuals ontology to support better modularity and improve reasoning performance when they are not required (time for reasoning with HermiT over the primary ontologies in FND, BE, and FBC, without individuals, was reduced from 30+ minutes to just under 3 minutes as a result)</li>
<li>FBC-221  - moved certain registration authority individuals f… (#726)</li>
<li>FBC-221  - revised the ontology name from International Financial Organizations to International Registries and Authorities to better reflect its scope</li>
<li>FBC-223  - cleaned up logic issues in securities identification individuals, eliminating reasoning issues, adjusted definitions for ISO 704 compliance and added missing definitions</li>
<li>FBC-223  - initial pass at unwinding a logic issue related to baskets and registries in some ontologies that extend these concepts</li>
	</ul>	
      </li>
      

      <li><p>Foundations</p>
	<p><i>Highlights</i></p>
	<ul>
	  Most of the work performed in FND this quarter involved integration and/or elimination of informative ontologies that were largely duplicative.  However, there were a few changes of note:
<li>the addition of new assessments and ratings ontologies, which are now released,</li>
<li>the addition of a new combined date time datatype that is useful for mapping knowledge graphs to back-end data stores whose representation of dates and times is inconsistent, and</li>
<li>the addition of identifiers associated with certain identity documents in support of data privacy and knowledge graph integration/interoperability use cases.	  </li>
	</ul>

	<p>Detailed Changes:</p>
	<ul>

<li>FND-240  - loosens the restrictions on certain date time properties to use the new combined date time datatype or its equivalent and as appropriate for representation of acquisition dates and times, sale dates and times, any member of a dated collection, such as a series of dates related to prices in a yield curve, etc.</li>
<li>FND-240  - loosens the restrictions on certain date time prop… (#714)</li>
<li>FND-240  - revised change note in Arrangements and definition of Asset per feedback</li>
<li>FND-243  - moved the properties 'produces' and 'isProducedBy' from Products and Services (deprecated) to relations (#720)</li>
<li>FND-244  - additional commits to finalize elimination of the policy ontology</li>
<li>FND-244  - eliminate and/or move references from business goals in the BusinessExt module to other locations where they can be widely used; migrate concepts including hasObjective and BusinessObjective from the LegalPersons ontology to Objectives in FND to facilitate reuse of those concepts more broadly, with primary requirements related to investment objectives and others required for disclosures, risk, fund-related definitions, etc.</li>
<li>FND-244  - eliminated remaining references to AgentsContexts from FND/BusinessExt</li>
<li>FND-244  - revised the definition of business objective to incorporate a time frame and that it requires resources to execute; added restriction on a time period to the higher-level objective class; moved policy and reporting policy to Legal Capacity and incorporated a restriction indicating that a policy implements a legal construct, goal or objective (note that law and regulation in FBC are subclasses of legal construct, as is duty)</li>
<li>FND-246  - augmented the definition of identity document, birth certificate, driver's license and passport to be identified by specific identifiers rather than just have a tag associated with them to enable queries supporting GDPR and other privacy laws</li>
<li>FND-246  - eliminated references to the Publications ontology from these 3 ontologies, and changed 'terms set' to 'terms' where it appeared, in line with the naming we've used in the released ontologies, also reduced some of the duplication in properties</li>
<li>FND-246  - this commit includes the changes mentioned - i.e., integrating identification schemes</li>
<li>FND-248  - cleaned up additional redundancy, references to informative ontologies, and ambiguity where possible</li>
<li>FND-248  - corrected hygiene issues</li>
<li>FND-248  - eliminated all references to the FND/MathExt/Amounts ontology, including revision of embedded definitions that leveraged concepts from Amounts, such as MD/TemporalCore TimedNumericAmount and a few other time-specific concepts; Note that there is significant work remaining to eliminate the TimeExt and MathExt remaining ontologies, which are on the roadmap but out of scope for this issue resolution</li>
<li>FND-248  - eliminated references to the FND/MathExt/Quantities ontology, which was used only in one place and added no value</li>
<li>FND-248  - further refinement and elimination of some additional, duplicative properties based on feedback</li>
<li>FND-250  - eliminated reference to the assessment definition from the National Education glossary per request</li>
<li>FND-250  - revised the assessments ontology to add a reference to assessment activity, clean up the definition a bit, and add the concept of an opinion, needed for ratings</li>
<li>FND-250  - revised the assessments ontology to add a referenc… (#722)</li>
<li>FND-251  - eliminate the informative physical ontology, which was only used by other informative ontologies and included concepts that were too abstract to be required in any released ontology (#723)</li>
<li>FND-252  - addressed missing definition for hasExerciseTerms</li>
<li>FND-252  - corrected hygiene issues (missed references)</li>
<li>FND-252  - eliminated references to PublicationsExt in exchange traded options ontologies; merged exchange traded options, options exchanges, and options standardized terms to eliminate circularities and duplications</li>
<li>FND-252  - eliminated references to the PublicationsExt ontology in DER/ExchangeTradedDerivatives futures ontologies, and eliminated circular dependencies between the 3 futures ontologies by merging them, eliminating a number of duplicate properties, reusing concepts from the DerivativesBasics ontology</li>
<li>FND-252  - eliminated remaining references to the PublicationsExt ontologies</li>
<li>FND-252  - further revisions to the exchange traded options ontology to eliminate references to margin and clean up details with respect to contract terms; moved property hasExerciseTerms to to ExerciseConventions so that it can be used more broadly</li>
	</ul>
      </li>





      <li><p>Indices and Indicators</p>
	<p><i>Highlights</i></p>
	  The primary changes to IND this quarter were related to
	<ul>
<li>migration of basic statistical concepts from IND to FND to enable wider use, and</li>
<li>work towards support for time series data, which is expected to be completed during Q3, to facilitate representation of versioned, time series indicators, market rates, and other reference data</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Detailed Changes:</p>
	<ul>
<li>IND-24  - augmented the definition of statistical measure as discussed by the IND FCT and migrated all of the general statistics concepts from EconomicIndicators to FND/Utilities/Analytics (created/revised in FND, eliminated references to the quantities and units ontology to avoid circular dependencies and deprecated in IND)</li>
<li>IND-24  - augmented the definition of statistical measure as … (#721)</li>
<li>IND-24  - eliminated "smart quote" in explanatory note</li>
<li>IND-24  - eliminated all non-government source information used as input to definition development; normalized a few more definitions to be ISO 704 compliant, which the entire ontology now is, and added notes and references from the OECD glossary where possible.</li>
<li>IND-79  - eliminated unnecessary restriction (since the one that counts is in the IND interest rates ontology)</li>
<li>IND-79  - further integration of the disentangled quantities/analytics ontologies, deprecation of the confusing 'Rate' class and replacement of that class with an appropriate concept in other ontologies that referenced it</li>
<li>IND-79  - further refinements based on comments</li>
<li>IND-79  - initial pass unwinding dependencies between Analytics and Quantities and Units, elimination of redundant QuantitiesExt ontologies, addition of qualified and scoped measure</li>
<li>IND-79  - integrated further changes to better align with the BLS model</li>
<li>IND-79  - replaced use of actualExpression (annotation property) in IND with the equivalent property in Analytics and removed the equivalent property axiom, which was causing Widoco to fail in the publication process (unparsed triple error likely caused by a bug in the OWL API)</li>
	</ul>
      </li>



      <li><p>Securities</p>
	<p><i>Highlights</i></p>
<p>Most of the work this quarter built on work completed in Q1 to further simplify and clean up the bonds ontology in preparation for review and release in Q3 and to integrate / eliminate the last two informative ontologies remaining in the Securities hierarchy.
</p>

	<p>Detailed Changes:</p>
	<ul>
<li>SEC-82  - eliminated remaining references to the provisional Values ontology; further simplified the notion of a bond registrar</li>
<li>SEC-82  - further simplification, normalization of definitions with added explanatory notes, etc.</li>
<li>SEC-82  - prelminary pass to simplify the bonds ontology, update certain definitions to conform to ISO 704 requirements, eliminate duplicate or unnecessary content that is not used elsewhere in FIBO</li>
<li>SEC-82 - eliminated spurious characters in certain definitions / notes</li>
<li>SEC-82 - second iteration to continue the simplification and integration process, eliminate unnecessary concepts, clean up definitions, etc.</li>
<li>SEC-83  - rationalized and simplified the securities regulation and restriction hierarchies, moved regulation from FBC to FND as a part of that process, and eliminated informative RegulatoryRestrictions and RegulatoryRequirements ontologies as a part of the rationalization process.</li>

	</ul>
      </li>
      


      

      
      <li><p>Infrastructure</p>
	<p><i>Highlights</i></p>
	<p>The main update to infrastructure this quarter is the new website design, made to coordinate with the edmcounci.org web site </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

	</ul>
      </li>
      
      <li><p>Financial Business and Commerce</p>

<li>    FBC-210 - replaced markets individuals to use (1) 'MIC-' as the prefix for the codes and (2) 'Exchange-' followed by the code for the markets, to ensure uniqueness of URIs, and updated the markets and codes to reflect the Jan 2019 publication by ISO</li>
<li>    FBC-210 - revised US examples to update URIs to match the new representation strategy in the basic MIC codes ontology</li>

<li>    FBC-211 - added restriction with respect to the issuer of a given rating and tweaked definitions</li>
<li>    FBC-211 - added the notion of an assessment which could have a rating as an output</li>
<li>    FBC-211 - added two additional properties to the Relations ontology, evaluates, and is evaluated by, after review with the FND FCT</li>
<li>    FBC-211 - changed rating scheme to rating scale based on feedback and review of rating agency definitions</li>

<li>    FBC-211 revised cardinalities, definitions per team discussions</li>
<li>    FBC-212 - determined that one of the issues with the individuals was related to the identifiers for banking functions, which were originally organization identifiers, thus causing all functional entities that had such identifiers to be inferred to be formal organizations (introducing a logical inconsistency); added a new financial service provider identifier that is determined by function, corrected a restriction in control parties, referenced the new identifier and eliminated redundant restrictions in US regulatory agencies and used (and tested) the fix with US financial services entities individuals and added new content to reflect the revised BE entity ownership properties</li>
<li>    FBC-214 - added USMarketsAndExchanges to the metadata for FBC Functional Entities (eliminated an erroneous imports statement)</li>

	</ul>	
      </li>
      

      <li><p>Foundations</p>
	<p><i>Highlights</i></p>
	<ul>
<li>	  simplification of the party hierarchy,</li>
<li>	  addition of a new combined date / date time / date time stamp datatype that can 
be used as needed to map to inconsistent data and support time stamps 
	  that include milliseconds or smaller increments,</li>
<li>the introduction of  new, provisional assessments and ratings content</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Detailed Changes:</p>
	<ul>
<li>    FND-230 Make hasMaturityLevel an AnnotationProperty.</li>

<li>    FND-232 - simplified the definition of independent party to correspond to its usage in general across FIBO</li>
<li>    FND-235 - augment the financial dates ontology with a composite date value datatype that allows certain properties and restrictions to vary with respect to the precise datatype representation of a date for use in mappings and cases where the representation is ambiguous; leverage this new datatype in the definition of an occurrence (event)</li>

<b>2018 Q4</b>
    <p><i>Full change record</i></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Business Entities</p>
	<p><i>Highlights</i></p>
	<ul>
	  
	  <li>Integrated support for GLEIF LEI Level 2 accounting consolidation relationships and made other revisions with respect to GLEIF LEI representation to better support automation of reference data and reflect the nature of the GLIEF published information with respect to entity legal forms</li>
	  <li>Simplified the hierarchies involving formal organizations and legal entities substantially, including deprecating 'formally constituted organization' and 'juridical person', and adding the latter as a synonym of 'legal entity'</li>
	  <li>Clarified the distinction between a natural person and legally competent natural person</li>
	  
	</ul>
	<p>Detailed Changes:</p>
	<ul>
<li>    BE-195 - moved the restriction that an entity may be identified by a legal entity identifier from LEIEligibleEntity to LegalPerson and deprecated LEIEligibleEntity as a part of organization hierarchy simplification</li>
<li>    BE-181  - replaced 'natural person' with 'legally competent natural person' across ontologies where that concept was required</li>
<li>    BE-181  - added a new class to replace 'natural person', called 'legally competent natural person', for the sake of clarity</li>
<li>    BE-181  - deprecate legally capable person in favor of natural person, which includes a more general definition of the concept of legal competence.  Legal competence is jurisdiction and situation specific - in some jurisdictions, people that are under the age of 'maturity' can apply for jobs, can enter into contracts, are considered competent to make certain decisions for themselves in a court of law, etc.  For the purposes of FIBO, legal competence generally means that an individual can take on liabilities, such as taxes on earnings, or fees associated with an account, or potentially take on a debt, or own property or join the military.  The revised definition of natural person includes the concept of liability capacity and is jurisdiction specific.  Merging these two concepts in favor of natural person simplifies the conceptual representation and hierarchy and clarifies what is intended.</li>
<li>    BE-180  - as a part of the organizational hierarchy simplification, replaced uses of FormallyConstitutedOrganization with either FormalOrganization, LegalPerson or LegalEntity, as appropriate, across FIBO domains</li>
<li>    BE-180  - merged the concept of FormallyConstitutedOrganization with LegalEntity in BE, given that the definitions were almost identical and that FormallyConstitutedOrganization simply added complexity without significant value to the organizational hierarchy</li>
<li>    BE-180  - replaced references to FormallyConstitutedOrganization with FormalOrganization from FND, which eliminated a number of out-of-domain references in FND informative ontologies</li>
<li>    BE-180  - merge the definitions of legal entity and juridical person to simplify the legal persons and organizations hierarchies; make Polity a child of GovernmentBody, again to simplify the hierarchy</li>
<li>    BE-178  - revised the definition of supranational entity to use the definition from ISO 20275, added adapted from the ISO standard</li>
<li>    BE-156  - revised property naming from parent / child to direct ownership and investment, loosened certain ownership relationships to allow business entities (including sole proprietorships), legal entities, and not for profit organizations (such as certain foundations used for tax purposes primarily) but not ownership of people (i.e., broader than legal entity but not as broad as legal person)</li>
<li>    BE-156  - added a relationship period qualifier and made active and inactive relationships status individuals of that qualifier, revised definitions accordingly; reorganized the two individuals of relationship status so that the status itself is at the end of the name and revised definitions to be closer to the GLIEF definitions for these status indicators; simplified names of consolidatation related properties</li>
<li>    BE-156  - added new records property to Documents to allow a record to reference the thing that it is recording</li>
<li>    BE-156  - added restriction on entity ownership for relationship classifier (which would cover the information relevant to the time frame for the relationship)</li>
<li>    BE-156  - loosened constraints on properties in Contracts - is evidenced by and is evidence for; slight revisions to representation in ownership parties based on testing</li>
<li>    BE-156  - added a couple of missing concepts, revised restrictions after review of test data</li>
<li>    BE-156  - initial version of a revised entity ownership reified relation for the purposes of GLEIF level 2 support</li>
<li>    BE-141  - added synonyms for code sets (also addresses FBC-172)</li>
<li>    BE-141  - added the registry / registry entry for entity legal forms; added the entity legal form identifier and scheme, as well as individuals for ISO 20275 code set and ISO 17442 code set (LEI)</li>
<li>    BE-114  - added explanatory note indicating that a license may also be an agreement or contract, depending on the license and jurisdiction</li>
<li>    BE-141  - moved restriction on hasLegalFormAbbreviation to EntityLegalForm; added new property hasTransliteratedLegalFormAbbreviation and other restrictions to EntityLegalForm to correspond to the GLIEF ELF standard</li>
<li>    BE-114  - modified the parent of License from Agreement to LegalDocument, which is more appropriate (all licenses, including fishing licenses, business licenses, and software licenses are legal documents, but not necessarily agreements since they are often unilateral)</li>
<li>    BE-141  - deprecated hasLegalFormAbbreviation in Corporations per BE-141; moved it to LEIEntities where the actual legal form is referenced and added the hasLegalFormAbbreviation and restriction there in parallel with the reference to the actual legal form</li>
<li>    BE-115  - revised the definition of power of attorney to eliminate a restriction that the authoritiy is limited to the lifetime of the principal; moved some of the content to an explanatory note, added another source and a restriction that it has an effective date (in most cases, not all, thus min 0)</li>
<li>    BE-110  - modified the definition of responsible party to correspond to its intended usage, i.e. with respect to people rather than organizations as well as people</li>
<li>    BE-88  - generalized the parents of beneficial owner to be beneficiary and owner; revised the definition to move an explanatory component out to an explanatory note, updated annotation properties as appropriate</li>

	<ul><li>Primary changes this quarter in DER were bug fixes.</li></ul>
	
	<p>Detailed Changes:</p>

	  <li>    DER-59  - eliminated improperly defined valuationTime property which is not referenced by anything</li>
	  <li>    DER-59  - eliminated the extraneous property for relativeNotionalAmount, as the class that it was used on already had a restriction on notional amount</li>
	  <li>      DER-20  - made having a notional step schedule optional on an interest rate swap leg to cover the simpler cases where that level of complexity is not required; the notional is already available at the leg level to support calculation of a basic payment</li>
	  <li>    DER-20  - made having a notional step schedule optional on an interest rate swap leg to cover the simpler cases where that level of complexity is not required; the notional is already available at the leg level to support calculation of a basic payment</li>

      <li><p>Business and Commerce</p>
	<p><i>Highlights</i></p>
	<ul><li>Primary changes this quarter in FBC were related to inclusion of ISO 10383 MIC codes, which is now entirely automated. three months were processed, with September 2018 initially, followed by November and finally December 2018, which allowed for refinement of the automation process.</li>

	  <li>FBC-194  - replaced hasCity with hasMunicipality with the proper reference for the address of the Bank of Canada</li>
	  <li>FBC-194  - added a property for hasMunicipality to allow registration addresses to incorporate a business center or municipality as a first class object rather than strictly as a text string (as in hasCity); both are needed for cases where some city has not been represented as a municipality individual in FIBO (although geonames could be referenced as an alternative source, as desired)</li>

	  <li>FBC-194  - revised the definition of holding company to be a child of functional business entity rather than business, which is more appropriate given the function of a holding company</li>
	  <li>FBC-194  - revised business dates to allow the property, has business center, to be used by more than the class called business day adjustment; revised the definition of business day adjustment to allow for the same adjustment to apply to multiple business centers (also agrees with the FpML specification); added a new ontology called business centers in FBC to support the set of FpML business centers, required for specifying the business center in which a given exchange operates</li>
	  <li>FBC-194  - added general holding company to certain organization definitions</li>
	  <li>FBC-194  - created the notion of a generic holding company, needed to represent the structures present in the various exchange corporate hierarchies</li>
	  <li>FBC-194  - modified the relationship between market segment and the operating level market it is a part of; changed the reference from operatesInCity to operatesInMunicipality (strings to things) to allow us to reference FpML business centers</li>
	  <li>FBC-194  - see prior comment re: definitions, the addition of New York Stock Exchange LLC, etc.</li>
	  <li>FBC-194  - added market segment-level and operating level markets under exchange; eliminated "individual representing" from various definitions, added New York Stock Exchange LLC and revised other definitions accordingly</li>
	  <li>FBC-194  - deprecated the class called "market" and made market a synonym of exchange; added exchanges to the example exchanges and markets in the US</li>

      </li>


      <li><p>Loans</p>
	<p><i>Highlights</i></p>
	<p>Primary changes this quarter in LOAN involved staging with respect to some of the older LOAN provisional content in preparation for further integration work in 2019.</p>
	<p>Detailed Changes:</p>	
	<ul>

      <li><p>Securities</p>
	<p><i>Highlights</i></p>
	<p>The revisions to SEC content this quarter include minor changes to released ontologies as well as significant development of some of the content in provisional debt instruments planned for release in 2019:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Integrated 6 SEC/Debt/Bonds ontologies into a single coherent ontology, eliminating circular references between them</li>
	  <li>Eliminated redundant content in SEC/Debt/DebtFoundations and SEC/Debt/MoneyMarkets and moved the resulting ontologies, including 'traded short-term debt' and 'exercise conventions' to the SEC/Debt level and moved remaining concepts that were not redundant into the SEC/Debt/DebtInstruments ontology or to other provisional ontologies under LOAN, DER, or SEC/Debt/AssetBackedSecurities</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Detailed Changes:</p>	
	<ul>
	  <li>SEC-75  - clean up some of the labels and definitions, add missing definitions (not all, just some per the concepts relevant to FINRA), bridge a few properties to the proper concepts in the debt instruments ontology, etc.</li>
	  <li>SEC-75  - correct label and definition on has scheduled maturity date</li>
	  <li>SEC-71  - completed integration of CallEvent as a RedemptionEvent in DebtInstruments and eliminated the related axiom in Bonds</li>
	  <li>SEC-67  - eliminate circular reference to traded short term debt in the TimeExt/Time ontology as well as unused notions related to up to one year and more than one year durations</li>
	  <li>SEC-67  - eliminate references to the TimeExt/Time ontology from exchange traded options to facliltate minimal clean up of the TimeExt/Time ontology</li>
	  <li>SEC-67  - renamed MoneyMarketDebtInstrument to MoneyMarketInstrument, which is the name it is commonly known by; eliminated the equivalence in that class and made various other instruments children of money market instrument given that the set included in the union was incomplete (so the logic would disallow other kinds of money market instruments), revised the definition to use one from the OECD Glossary (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)</li>
	  <li>SEC-67  - eliminated asset repurchase agreement and liability repurchase agreement as they are not used in the relevant literature (though there are kinds of REPOs missing from this ontology)</li>
	  <li>SEC-67  - eliminate references to the TimeExt/Time ontology in Debt/DebtFoundations, Debt/MoneyMarkets, and Debt/AssetBackedSecurities, and merge the small REPOs ontology into TradedShortTermDebt</li>
	  <li>SEC-67  - eliminated additional redundancy in the TimeExt/Time ontology related to business day conventions and business calendars made moot by recent changes to import all FpML business day conventions and business centers in FBC (and due to their lack of usage by anything else)</li>
	  <li>SEC-65  - revised metadata for the SEC/Debt/AssetBackedSecurities module to reflect the name change</li>
	  <li>SEC-65  - renamed the module called "AssetBacked" to "AssetBackedSecurities" to align with FIBO naming conventions and per SEC-65; modified URIs in all ontologies that reference anything in this module accordingly</li>
	  <li>SEC-63  - corrected namespace prefix on TreasuryBill</li>
	  <li>SEC-63  - eliminated the domain of hasTypicalDurationToMaturity which seemed too narrow</li>
	  <li>SEC-63  - revised the range of hasTypicalDurationToMaturity to be the same as it's parent property and added a definition for it</li>
	  <li>SEC-63  - eliminated circularity in TradedShortTermDebt, refined content, and moved it to SEC/Debt; updated references to it, and eliminated the MoneyMarkets subdomain</li>
	  <li>SEC-62  - moved the contents of the term deposits ontology to clients and accounts in FBC; revised the definitions related to 'term deposit' according to regulatory definitions provided by the FDIC, which regulates deposit accounts in the US, and whose definitions other countries rely on as the source for the same or similar concepts</li>
	  <li>SEC-61  - moved LoanParticipationNotes to AssetBackedSecurities, noting that it is (1) lacking concepts about loan participation (which small and medium sized banks do to spread risk for a given loan that is larger than what they can or want to commit funds to), which should be in loans, and (2) a basic syndicated loan, typically issued to a large company and which is a very large loan, again used to spread risk across institutions, which should also be in loans, where this ontology includes the concept of a security based on a syndicated loan</li>
	  <li>SEC-61  - eliminated the redundant hasUnderlying property (given that it is in derivatives and has access to that property) from participation notes and moved it to DER/DerivativesContracts</li>
	  <li>SEC-60  - corrected prefix for FloatingInterestRate and added a definition to hasNotificationProvision</li>
	  <li>SEC-60  - eliminate the remaining DebtCashflowTerms ontology and related DebtFoundatations metadata file</li>
	  <li>SEC-60  - move remaining properties in DebtCashflowTerms to their proper homes</li>
	  <li>SEC-60  - corrected restriction with respect to repayment date</li>
	  <li>SEC-60  - eliminated spurious restrictions in bonds cashflow variants and unused imports (references) to debt cashflow terms where they occurred</li>
	  <li>SEC-60  - eliminate remaining references to the DebtCashflowTerms ontology</li>
	  <li>SEC-60  - revised payment schedule to use occurrence rather than occurrence kind (i.e., payment), added property has payment schedule to support integration of debt, debt cashflow terms, and loans</li>
	  <li>SEC-59  - normalize spelling of issuance programme using 'mme' spelling specifically due to its appropriateness and usage in this case from the domain perspective</li>
	  <li>SEC-59  - clean up remaining content from DebtFoundations/DebtIssuanceTerms and move it all to BP/SecuritiesIssuance/DebtIssuance where it is used</li>
	  <li>SEC-59  - eliminate references to debt issuance terms in mortgage-backed and pool-backed securities</li>
	  <li>SEC-59  - additional redundancy elimination in Debt Issuance Terms</li>
	  <li>SEC-59  - moved terms from Debt Issuance to Asset backed SPVs where they were used and started eliminating duplication in Debt Issuance Terms related to bonds</li>
	  <li>SEC-59  - eliminated references to securities issuance SPV in participation notes (extends issuer which is already inherited via a restriction, and the need for that level of specificity overly complicates the model), eliminated unused references to other ontologies</li>
	  <li>SEC-56  - eliminate the now redundant DebtInstrumentGuaranties ontology and revise module metadata accordingly</li>
	  <li>SEC-56  - moved the bond insurance class from debt instrument guaranties to bonds common, since bond insurance can impact pricing</li>
	  <li>SEC-56  - clean up and move most of the non-redundant contents of the DebtInstrumentGuarantees ontology to the Guaranty ontology in FBC/Debt</li>
	  <li>SEC-55  - moved relevant restrictions from DebtFinance to the various loan and asset-backed securities ontologies where they belong, and then eliminated references remaining to the DebtFinance ontology and finally eliminated the ontology itself</li>
	  <li>SEC-42  - eliminated now redundant DER/DerivativesContracts ExerciseConventions (replaced with SEC/Debt/ExerciseConventions or concepts moved to Options)</li>
	  <li>SEC-42  - eliminate now redundant STRIPs and Bonds metadata ontologies</li>
	  <li>SEC-42  - integrated basic concepts related to strips and revised the metadata to account for the migration of bonds to the higher level Debt ontology</li>
	  <li>SEC-42  - eliminate restriction error in DebtPricingYields (this was there previously, perhaps highlighted by corrections in the bonds ontology)</li>
	  <li>SEC-42  - eliminate references to the DER/DerivativesContracts/ExerciseConventions ontology and replace them with the revised SEC/Debt/ExerciseConventions ontology</li>

<li>All Municipalities in addition to the Business Centers referenced in the ISO 10383 Codes for exchanges and market identification (MIC) as of 2018-09-11T15:57:43 and </li>
<li>All markets and exchanges and related MIC codes as defined in ISO 10383 Codes for exchanges and market identification (MIC) as of 2018-09-11T15:57:43 </li>
<li>Added model-level support for representation of industry classification codes including the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes (not including the reference individuals)</li>
</ul>
    <p><i>Full change record</i></p>
    <ul>
<li><p>FBC</p>
<p>Integrated reference data for FpML business centers and ISO 10383 MIC Codes, including:</p>
  <ul>
<li>corrected long dashes in some Nordic auction on demand markets and related codes</li>
<li>corrected prefix on US states in business centers individuals</li>
<li>corrected the following references for municipalities: Ebene_City --> Ebene, Frankfurt_Am_Main --> Frankfurt, Klagenfurt_Am_Woerthersee --> Klagenfurt_am_Woerthersee, New_Jersey --> Summit, Nicosia_lefkosia --> Nicosia, S-hertogenbosch --> s-Hertogenbosch, Saint-petersburg--> Saint-Petersburg, St__Peter_Port --> Saint_Peter_Port, and Washington_new_York --> Washington_New_York</li>
<li>eliminated references to non-existent markets for codes for XXXX, BILT, and XOFF</li>
<li>integrated the markets individuals with the FBC European all file</li>
<li>corrected another issue with the market codes related to SWISS CANTO</li>
<li>added the example US markets individuals to the metadata for FBC Functional Entities</li>
<li>revised US examples to reuse the codes and references in the primary market individuals ontology</li>
<li>fixed additional issues in the generated codes, e.g. characters that were not proper in URIs, ampersands that were not escaped, etc.</li>
<li>relaxed restriction on exchange name so that we can map detailed individuals that reflect the nature and other facts about an exchange to the generated content</li>
<li>revised market identifiers to correct various issues</li>
<li>corrected business centers that were modeled to be in Taiwan that are actually in India</li>

<li>revised to add more market segment level codes</li>
<li>revised the type on several business center codes to business day adjustment codes</li>
<li>corrected references to the two modified business days</li>
<li>revised 2 business centers to normalize the names of two of them; added business day adjustments for a few that were missing</li>
<li>revised business centers, including all of those processed automatically from FpML (a couple still need tweaking and 3 business day adjustments to be added)</li>

<li>added business center to exchange definitions to test reasoning</li>
<li>modified approach to representing cities as parts of subdivisions rather than as subdivisions of subdivisions to get desired reasoning results</li>
<li>initial pass at encoding FpML business centers, starting with those in the U.S.</li>
<li>revised the definition of holding company to be a child of functional business entity rather than business, which is more appropriate given the function of a holding company</li>

<li>see prior comment re: definitions, the addition of New York Stock Exchange LLC, etc.</li>
<li>added market segment-level and operating level markets under exchange; eliminated "individual representing" from various definitions, added New York Stock Exchange LLC and revised other definitions accordingly</li>
<li>deprecated the class called "market" and made market a synonym of exchange; added exchanges to the example exchanges and markets in the US</li>
<li>corrected prefix for hasWebsite</li>
<li>minor revisions to the markets ontology to better reflect the standard; introduction of individuals defining the NYSE as an example</li>
<li>add support for ISO 10383 Codes for exchanges and market identification (MIC) - model only, not including individuals</li>
<li>0 - made having a notional step schedule optional on an interest rate swap leg to cover the simpler cases where that level of complexity is not required; the notional is already available at the leg level to support calculation of a basic payment</li>

    <li>SEC-40  - eliminated the subclass on security in securities ext -- not al securities are transferable contracts</li>

    <li>SEC-51  - eliminated reference to securities tax treatment (which was overly simplified and largely unused) in bonds tax treatment (which may also be overly simplified and not useful, but for the Bonds FCT to address)</li>
    <li>SEC-51  - eliminated restriction with respect to securities tax treatment in SecuritiesExt, which is largely about settlement, but where the tax details available in the tax treatment ontology were overly simplified and insufficient to provide utility; an independent effort with respect to taxation generally is needed eventually, once the FIBO community determines that it is a priority.</li>
    <li>SEC-51  - eliminated securities tax treatment, which was tiny, overly simplified, and not very useful in general once references to it were eliminated</li>
    <li>SEC-43  - eliminated numerous duplicate concepts and properties from LoansEvents and replaced them with their equivalents from released ontologies</li>
