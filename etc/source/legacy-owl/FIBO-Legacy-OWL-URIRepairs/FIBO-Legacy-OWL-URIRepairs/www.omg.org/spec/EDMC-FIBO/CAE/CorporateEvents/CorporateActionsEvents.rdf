      <skos:editorialNote>Units usually comprise warrants and bond or warrants and equity. Securities may be combined at the request of the security holder or based on market convention. Examples of automatic ones: If you have a unit with warrants and the warrants expore, they would be detached immediately. Is there a Notification? They would have to break up the unit as the unit no longer exists. Have to deliver off the unit and put the bond back into the client's account or into you position as an operation. depositories would change the CUSIP from the Unit CUSIP to the Bond CUSIP. Who initiates? The issuer has to do this based on the terms. Attavhment and Detachment also applicable to TRahcnes in CDOs. At some point a tranch might attach at 6 and detach at 10% for example. This might be a corporate action as it is declared when the issue is created - the attachment and deta chment points are specified inthe prospectus for the deal and would not be seen as a corporate action.

      <rdfs:label>Bonus Issue</rdfs:label>
      <skos:definition>Event in which security holders are awarded additional assets free of payment from the issuer in proportion to their holding. These may be from current profits or may be from accumulated reserves of the company.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>There are different taxation rules for the Bonus Issue compared to the Dividend. There could also be a difference in the ranking of the shares that are given, to what the holder already holds. Always announce the event on the ones that they hold, and based on the holding they are given additional shares. They may be of a different ranking. Bonus Issues increase the capital base but not the capital value of the company, since all they are doing is diluting the share capital. Difference from Dividend: Increases holding of shareholder. Other similar terms: Awards; Also see difference between Dividend and Bonus. Dividend is from current profits and bonus may be from accumulated reserves of the company. Separate this into 2 terms. We have: Capitalisation Issue Bonus rights Issue Original SWIFT definition - strippoed out synonyms for the formal definition above: "Attribution Gratuite (FR); Scrip Issue (GB); Capitalisation Issue. Security holders are awarded additional assets free of payment from the issuer in priportion to their holding." More 25 May A scrip issue is the issue of new shares at no charge pro rata to the holder of existing shares. This means the term Scrip Issue is as modeled here "no charge". But Capitalization becomes close to this in definition. More detail May 25: No change to the par value of the share so why would there be a change inthe capitaliation? Because from an accountingf point of view they change the value of overall capital of the company - they don't change the market value of the conpany but the accountants will record an increase in the issued capital of the company. This is the disctinction between nominal capital and the market capital. Nominal - there is more nominal share value.</skos:editorialNote>

They are a tradeoff from cash dividends. Other terms to model: A "Scheme of Arrangment" - does this change the capital reserves or is it just another word for restructure.

      <skos:definition>A general kind of issue which increases the capital base of the company. Other kinds of issue: Like a Bonus Issue except that it would increase the capital. There could be several events which could be considered as Capitalization Issues. 25 May Later research: Scrip or Bonus issue is seen to be synonymous with this but more accurate. However, we question this - if you have the chance to purchase shares at a particular price (which is a right) would extend the definition of .. 20 July: this could have a broader meaning than Capital reserves Distribution It would include distribution of capital and trying to raise capital by additional capital injection Example: If the company issues bonds, that also changes the capital base. Now to change the capital base, there are two directions, up or down. Bonus issue falls into the above because you are increasing the capital base. A rights issue also increateses the capital base. Distributions of capital has the opposite effect. Paying out cash to reduce those items that are in your reserves. the reserves are greater than you need so you pay out cash on those. Labeling: capitalization implies the creation of capital so only suggests an increase the capital base</skos:definition>

      <skos:editorialNote>Removed from scope of this term and moved to Issuer Corporate Action: "This is an action which is compulsory on the issuer of the security." - REVIEW AND CLEAN OUT OF HERE Earlier review notes (pre refinement of this scope). REVIEW AND CLEAN OUT: Broader definition would also include things which might change the market price (for debt or equity), there asre things fo which you have to notify the market. these do not necessarily include changes to the details of the security. Most CAE will change the market perception. Not all actions which change the market perception are Corporate Events. Suggestion A corporate action is a generic class not actually homogenous, one of whcih si the Corporate Action of providin information to the market. There are legal requirements in most jurisdicitons saying that companies must advise their shareholders or bondhoders, about things whic might change the price. A separate kind of event notifies holders of securities (shares or bonds) of events which require an aciton on the part of the older (mandatory or bvoluntart) of the holder of the share. Then there are a set of events that don't get classified as CAE but have been included by SWIFT which are the actions by the holder, which would impact the issuer. These include calls on rights. Conclusion: There is one "Corporate Event" superclass of which everything is defined. earlier Event: Event has Terms and Conditions asspciated with it.

      <rdfs:label>Dutch Auction</rdfs:label>
      <skos:definition>Similar to a tender offer, a Dutch auction is an action by a party wishing to acquire a particular security. Current holders of the targeted security are invited to make an offer in which they would be willling to sell their holdings. UPDATE THIS DEFINITION: Similar to a tender offer, a Dutch auction is the result of an action by a third party wishing to acquire a particular security. Current holders of the targeted security are invited (and given a message by the issuer) to make an offer in which they would be willling to sell their holdings. OR It might also represent a separate scenario where third parties do this, as per the original SWIFT defition. You can only go to the Registrar which would the other scenario impossible. Agents and Registrars: The issue issuer os the company which issued the shares (as modeled); Most companies don't interact directly with the market to find out who they need to disseminate the info to. They can, but more likely the employ "Issuers Agent". That provides one point of contact from the organization. That agent handles all coms with the Registrars, and to the news wires etc., to disseminate the corporate action. Context: CAE only, or in the context of the Issue? When you issue the security you nominate an Agent, in the prospectus, there is specified an Issuing Agent. This is the one that does these things. Usually a merchant bank etc. in the old days. This is who will have directly facilitated that direct market engagement. Next question: This is part of going public, so these agents are appointed as part of going public.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>The party to which the offer is made need not be the holder. Details: Question on "Who is the actor?" Dutch auction would have multiple parties? What is the scenario? Usually happens when a company is about to go into administration. Looking at the scneario descried in the SWIFT definition - not clear if this is the only such scenario. Possibly the issuer has to notif ythe shareholders that the offer is being made. The offer is made by the third party but the notice is sent by the issuer (via their agent) and via the registrar who holds the details of who holds all the shares. Example: Lloyds banking group - most shares would be owned by the market, and a small percentage might be held by private investors. So in this scenario everyone has to be given the opportunity to sell at the given price. so the CAE message is still issued by the Issuer. SWIFT detailed names (synonym?)

Example: Where the "usually voluntary" comes in is that Announcement Payout Option 1: Cash 2. Stocks 3. Cash and Stock Holder picks option 1, 2 or 3 (= 1 &amp; 2). the voluntary aspect is where it's an Exchange Offer. It's mandatory to pick one of 1 - 3. Otherwise defaults to cash on payment date. Option Payout Componnet is the terms for the choice. Exchange Offer may be voluntary, not always Mandator With Choice. for example, there are legal qualifications on what is possible. Preceded by Tender Offer. Consequences dependent on scenarios. Once the firm making the offer gets to a given (legally defined) threshold e.g. 90% then they have the right to acquire all of the outstanding shares. An Exchange Offer is therefore a specialization of a Tender Offer. It's the specialization where the above mentioned requirements have been met. Further detail: Happens in a wider range of circumsntaces. Is soecifically associated with the issuer. this could be voluntary or not.

This is usually stated in the message. Is there a message even if there is no option? Yes.

Q: That is the point at there was a choice you would expect to see a message, or end up still having to generate it but with the choices. A: The ones with Choices come as announcements and don't ave to be generated by the Service. Older definitin (re-scoped now: An Event in which a payment occurs. Anything can have a payment event. If a thing hits a pay date, whether it's voluntary or mandatory, that's a payment event. Divide into: Securities Cash Combination Payment or Distribution? Are these exclusive? Take an event that's always a combination of options, and an option is a combination of payouts. Generates transactions - determine what txns happen when a customer chooses that option.

      <skos:editorialNote>There is a Put Bond, which is a kind of option in the sense that in return for getting less yield it allows you to put it back to the issuer. This means Put is a voluntary event. Therefore Mandatory Put is nonsensical? discussion: Or is it? If you are the issuer (therefore the granter of the option) then the event is to the holder). Partly paid shre for example gives the issuer the right to call funds but also has the right to put. So put is not by definition ... someone can have the right to put something. Conclusion: these do not appear to make sense as terms. A put bond allows the holder to redeem the issue. So this is by definition a voluntary event. Conclusion: go back to Pershing and find out what this term meant. Also we don't even know what kind of security this event was intended to refer to. We assume it refers to Put bond.

      <skos:editorialNote>From Free dictionary: Both the borrower's debt and the offsetting cash or bonds are removed from the balance sheet. In securities trading, where a clearing house becomes counterparty to each side of a trade, after the trade has been agreed. This is necessary to facilitate netting, and reduce counterparty risk exposure. The term has become popular recently, because of the growth of central counterparty clearing services in European cash equities markets. Origin: http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/defeasance SWIFT: Term:PDEF; "Partial Defeasance/Prefunding" Definition:"Issuer has money set aside to redeem a portion of an issue and the indenture states that the securities could be called earlier than the stated maturity."</skos:editorialNote>

      <skos:editorialNote>Note this is a holder action. There may be terms in the security giving the holder the ability to redeem early. If so, this is the event where that happens. Could apply to MTN as well as Bonds. We have defined MTN as a kind of Bond in this model. Review discussion: scope fo this: You could in theory put a share but no-one has come across this. Issuer may buy back shares at a given price but that's a different context - there's message for that. Makes an offer to repurchase shares. So therefore it is not possible in principle to have a call fo ra non debt instrument. In other circumstances e.g. compulsory acquisition in a takeover, is equivalent to this but it's a different term.</skos:editorialNote>

      <skos:definition>The distribution of rights to shareholders, in proportion to their equity holding.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>Does the Rights Distribution have to be proportion to the Shareholding? Sometimes this is offered at market prices, so all you are doing is offering shareholders the right to purchase. Conclusion: Not "in proportion" at all. REVISE: May also have Bonus Rights Issue, where you don' have a subscriptiojn price. This works like a rights issue but without a price attached to it. The rate of how many you can buy is definitely in proportion to your holding. The rate of distribution of the right is proportional to the holdings. Another difference: A Rights thing you have to pay for the additional shares if you choose to purchase them (exercise the right) whereas a Bonus Issue you do not pay, you get them outright for free. TWO PARTS: 1. Distribution of the rights in proportion to their holding 2. Exercise of the Rights. Hence RHDI v EXRI where EXRI is the exercising of the right to purchase the shares. The Rights that are distributed is a formal "Rights" instrument. This may have the sort of features we see in other rights instruments, such as restriction in when you can exercise it.</skos:editorialNote>

      <rdfs:label>Third Party Corporate Action</rdfs:label>
      <skos:definition>Some action initiated by some third party to the security, i.e. not the issuer.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>For example an offer made in the context of a takeover bid. Quesytion: if a third party makes such an action, doe sthe issuer also have to send out the notification? If the company is listed ,then the issuer is also obligated to notify holders that this thing is taking place. If both companies are listed, both have to send out a notificaiton to the market that they are doing this action. So the target company has to notify the market. sothere is a separate message which is the target company notifying its holders that a Tender Offer etc. is taking place. Is this in the ISO 15022 list? Are they both done with the same message? Example: Company B makes a bid in private to Company A. Discussion may go on in private. At some point you have to legally make it clear. So then Company A says "we are being approached by company B" and Company B has to put out a message saying "We are going to try and take over Company B". Are they the same message? The "Tender Offer" message type is rich enough that both things can be conveyed. So when we try to semantically distinguish the message from the action? The party making the bid completes different fields in the message, to those filled in by the target company. This then marks out the semantics of "This is a bid offer and I am the 3rd party" or "I am reporting a bid offer". Semantically: There is an event and there is a message describing the event. TElling the market about something happening to a company can be something your company is doing, or something causing a change in circumstances. Either way, the issuer of the affected securities has to identify and notify that there is something which might be affecting the price of their securities. May be internal or external things, and either way the issuer has to notify the market.</skos:editorialNote>
