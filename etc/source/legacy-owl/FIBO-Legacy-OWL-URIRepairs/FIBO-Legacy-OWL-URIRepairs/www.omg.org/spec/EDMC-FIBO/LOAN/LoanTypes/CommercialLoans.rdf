      <skos:editorialNote>Classifying loans by the type of borrower is less common than classifying it by things like collaterial (mortgagees) and so on. So the kind of borrower is not usually the main feature by which we try to classify the loan. So this exists but is not so often referred to.</skos:editorialNote>
