      <skos:definition>A floating leg or interest stream in the role of being a funding leg.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>Something with a reset at intervals. Review note: dont need this term? Basically there is a distinction to be drawn between a leg which, once observed, appears to be floating; and a leg which has the role of being a funding leg. For example, a floating interest rate leg in an IR Swap is an interest rate stream and has the same characteristics (is the same thing in a different role) as a floating interest rate stream used as the funding leg of some swap where the other leg is some asset income stream. This can only properly be resolved by dividing leg types into "streams" based on description (independent of their roles, therefore "Independent Thing", and "Legs" based on their roles. Sometimes the role is a matter of perspective or conjecture and may be less relevant.</skos:editorialNote>

      <rdfs:label>Payment Leg</rdfs:label>
      <skos:definition>A leg in which payments are made without reference to some underlying.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>This is generally used as the leg which one or another party pays to get into a deal. This might be a fixed leg or a floating leg and does not depend on some underlying. Earlier notes: These are related to interest amounts. These notes were originally defined for "Payment Leg" but that has been redefined 03 March in terms of the Payment Leg being defined from the holder perspective and not in contractual terms. The term "Funding Leg" is used in some FpML / ISDA documentation and is used here because it does not imply holder / counterparty perspective. Review session notes [for Payment Leg] 24 Feb: Fixed leg: Fixed sum of money or fixed amount each period for a number of periods. Floating Leg: more common. You pay a floating amount Either way, these are regular periodic payments just like a coupon schedule. Define these the same way as we did for bond coupons. Action: Payment Legs model like coupon schedules. More notes 10 Mar: This is used in the context of swapping equities or debt type instruments (not that different to an IR Swap). Making the distinction between a swap with a debt instrument underlying and making a swap with an Ir index underlying, is not a helpful distinction. Taking in terms of he assets being swapped - swapping an index is a shortcut for swapping the basket which underpins that index (for that sort of index). Index is a surrogate for the basket that underpins the index. Index v Index? ABX, CDX , ITraxx have baskets. (there are also credit default indices) Swapping the performance of the index in this sort of instance, not like CDS where the reference index is a credit index. Rather you are swpaping the resutnrs of the 2 indeces or rates. This is a slightyl arbitrary term. Funding leg may also still have an underlying (see for example wherre the Interest Rate leg has an I Index underlying). so for instance LIBOR as an index.</skos:editorialNote>

      <skos:definition>An exchange of streams of payments or other commitments over time according to specified terms.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>The most common type is an interest rate swap, in which one party agrees to pay a fixed interest rate in return for receiving a adjustable rate from another party. Review session notes: 10 Mar Helpful to split these according to the assets that are swapped. So for instance there are qquity swaps, commodity swaps where you swap different assets. These are not mutually exclusive to labels about Fund Leg, and so on, that are different ways that peoiple trading in those assets distinguish between those legs. For example in IR, we talk Fixed, Floating. capital Index Swap, where the return on oen leg is indexed to an inflation index but it's still an IR swap where the payment relates to an inflation index. So keeping the 2 legs in some sort of notion balance - example index annuity swap, capital index swap and so on. These terms refer to the behavior of the underlying swap rather than an arbitrary classification of what leg is what. Different structures of swap is less relevant. 17 March: Remember: the contract does not necessarily have 2 legs, but it usually would. The structure is in the "Transactions", the Commitments embodied in the two sides of those transactions, the "Legs" which are simply the embodiment of those commitments, and so on. Then the details structure is in the "Leg" definitions. Note also that different kinds of leg can have various structures regardless of how or why they are used in a contract.</skos:editorialNote>

      <skos:editorialNote>Original definition (different meaning - to be moved) A directional leg with effective date, termination date, where a payer makes a stream of payments of greater than zero value to a receiver. Used for example as Return Leg in an Equity Return Swap. Need to firm up the actual meaning. Note that this only has the terms already defined for "Swap Leg" above, namely Effective Date, Termination Date, Payer and Receiver. May be a redundant term. Assume from this and from the FpML model relations, that the Interest Leg and Return Leg in an Return Swap are sub types of this. Question whether the Return Swap is really an Equity product as suggested in FpML terms analysis. FpML: An abstract base class for all directional leg types with effective date, termination date, where a payer makes a stream of payments of greater than zero value to a receiver.</skos:editorialNote>

      <skos:definition>One leg of a Swap Transaction, as defined in the Swap Contract.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>A leg is defined as a "Side" of a transaction and as such it represents the commitment by one party to the other party to exchange something for something. A leg is often, but not necessarily, a cash flow stream. It may also be a strike, in statistical swaps where a single payment is netted out at the end of the contract. Types of leg include (these are the embodiments of kinds of commitment): - Asset Return legs - defining the return(s) on an underlying asset - Payment Legs - defining an agreed payment amount or stream of payments without reference to some underlying (may be used as funding leg to get into a deal) - Interest Leg: Defining a stream of interest payments defined in relation to some underlying interest rate (may be used as a funding leg of a deal or may be part of an IR Swap). - Strike Leg: abstract leg in which the parties agree to a strike price which is netted out against the outcome of the other leg at maturity This is defined in part of the Swap Contract. Modeling Approach: Originally this was defined as a kind of "Contract part" but in terms of the REA-derived terminology it is a side of a transaction, which itself is defined in (and so embodies) a Commitment on the part of one party to the other, as defined in the Contract. This means that this "Swap Leg" or "Swapstream" term defines cashflows, and in so doing those become a binding commitment on the part of the party for which this leg applies (the party that makes the corresponding commitment). SME Review notes: Feb 2010 Actual kinds of leg are defined elsewhere. There's no such thing as a Swap Leg in isolation. This is a description of the common concept of a Swap Leg but will not be seen in a set of instrument terms. 10 March 2010: Every swap has 2 legs but what they are depends on what assets are underlying. Sometimes the other leg is implied, so call it a fixed, strike leg versus a floating, realized statistic FpML Term:swapStream</skos:editorialNote>
