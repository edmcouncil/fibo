      <skos:editorialNote>Follows reviews. Reasons include that transactions always embody some contract. Subsequent thinking (see Review Notes for 27 Oct 2010) - the most general form of "Transaction" should be so general as to also include the "sweet shop" transaction. Also (per REA case studies), transaction parties include those within firms and therefore not between contractually capable entities. To resolve this, we introduced the notion of a Contractual Transaction Party, for transactions which are between entities. This relationship, which originally obtained for Transaction Party, now applies specifically for Contractual Transaction Party.</skos:editorialNote>

      <rdfs:label>Contractual Transaction Party</rdfs:label>
      <skos:definition>That which is party to a transaction which has contractual standing.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>In REA, transactions may include those which are not between legal entities,such as for example internal transactions within a business and between business units. This term Contractual Transaction Party forms the basis for all party definitions for transactions which have some formal contractual basis as being between discrete legal entities (legal persons or other contractually capable entities e.g. non incorporated entities). This is the basis for all derivatives transactions, securities market transactions and so on.</skos:editorialNote>

NOTE 2 Occurrences in time can either - be internal as mutually agreed to among the parties to a business transaction; and/or, - reference some common publicly available and recognized date/time referencing schema (e.g. one based on using ISO 8601 and/or ISO 19135).</skos:editorialNote>
