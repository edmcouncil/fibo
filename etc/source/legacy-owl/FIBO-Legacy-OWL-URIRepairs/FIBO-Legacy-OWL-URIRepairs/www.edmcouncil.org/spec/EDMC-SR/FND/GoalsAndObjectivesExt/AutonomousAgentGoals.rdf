<owl:ObjectProperty rdf:about="http://www.edmcouncil.org/spec/EDMC-SR/FND/GoalsAndObjectivesExt/AutonomousAgentGoals/pursuesGoal">
      <skos:definition>The thing acts in furtherance of some goal. Editorial Note: In one sense, having, seeking or pursuing some goal is a necessary and sufficient condition of being an autonomous entity, i.e. these are defined by their having goal seeking behaviour. This is represented here by naming the relationship one of pursuing rather than merely of having. Note that this has no relation to the concept of pursuing in the sense of "pursued by a bear", for the purposes of this ontology (the relationship between the two word senses is metaphorical). For this reason, the property is labeled "pursues goal" rather than simply "pursues". Other sense exist for having a goal, for example a plan or policy, a project plan etc. may be said to have one or more goals, even though these goals are actually pursued by the organization making the plan. To accommodate this, pursues has been made a property of Independent Thing, with a restriction for Autonomous Agent to carry the sense of this thing having, as its own, the property of pursues some Goal.</skos:definition>
