      <rdfs:label>Relationship Context</rdfs:label>
      <skos:definition>Any context in which Parties are defined.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>For example, a contractual relationship, transaction etc. This is any relationship in which something is defined as being party to something. It is from this context that it is possible to extract what are the parties involved, and, from those, what are the types of entity which may fulfil those roles. Scope Note: In the original FIBO models, some independent thing (e.g. Contract or organization) is modeled as being the thing to which the party is a party, implying the context itself (e.g. ownership, being a party to a contract). This treatment may change in favor of a more rigorous treatment of roles, and parties in roles.</skos:editorialNote>
