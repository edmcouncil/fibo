      <skos:editorialNote>Defines a kind of control which may be described in percentage terms or otherwise, as being control other than absolute, and therefore needing to be defined in terms of what are the activities on the part of the controlled entity, which the entity holding this control is able to direct the entity to do or not do. Scope Note: This is the basic relationship to "any" kind of activity; to define specific kinds of control one needs to define specific kinds of activity such as the ability to hire or replace executives, the ability to alter the capital structure of the entity, and so on. Types of control defined in terms of activities which regulators or (via statute), sovereigns may compel or prevent an entity doing, would also be framed in terms of extensions to the "Activity" and refinements of this relationship (either as sub-properties of or as restrictions on this relationship).</skos:editorialNote>
