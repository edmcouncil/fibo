      <skos:definition>The means by which some service is provided; something made available to the user of a service by the provider of that service.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>A facility may be concrete (as in a manufacturing facility) or abstract. It is a Relative Thing, since that which is made available as a facility may be an independent thing such as a factory. In the case of an abstract facility (such as a credit facility), there is no corresponding independent thing, except perhaps a set of standard terms that describe the available facility.</skos:editorialNote>

      <skos:definition>Some service in which things may be sold by third parties to other third parties, such as a department store concessoin or a securities exchange or trading venue.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>In financial markets, these may often differ only in terms of the conventions used, for example the pricing convention (per 100, by yield and so on). so a "Market" can also be seen in the abstract as one or other price.</skos:editorialNote>
