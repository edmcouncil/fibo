      <skos:editorialNote>This is defined as a Relative Thing, that is something is only regarded as being a kind of agent in the context in which it is the agent of something - nothing is simply an "Agent" in vacuo. Editorial Note: Since the term "Agent" is frequently used in technical applications to mean some independent thing which may be an agent in some context (usually the context implicit in the application), we have renamed this term to Enabling Agent. This allows us to retain some fidelity to the English language while avoiding confusion caused by the labels typically chosen by data modelers. Scope Note: This term is the abstraction from which are drawn various kinds of service providers i.e. business acting or capable of acting as agents in the provision of some service.</skos:editorialNote>
