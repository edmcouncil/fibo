FIBO Foundations is the essential scaffolding upon which the other FIBO modules are constructed.

It addresses concepts related to the types of entities that exist across the financial system, including corporations, functional entities, partnerships, private limited companies, sole proprietorships, trusts, government entities, and distinct types of legal entities. FIBO BE/DER also focuses on the concepts of ownership and control covering the types of parties that exist along with the expression of their capacities and powers. Moreover, FIBO BE/DER is a baseline domain ontology defining equities (equity instruments, depository receipts, equity issuance, limited partnership equity, shareholder rights and shareholder equity), bonds (concepts relating to cash debt instruments, listings, tax treatment, debt guarantees, parity variants, participation notes and cash flow), money markets (REPOs, term deposits and short term debt), and other securities (baskets, parametric schedules, pools, securities classification, securities identification, issuance, listings, restrictions and assets).
