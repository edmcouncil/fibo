        <skos:definition>The Floating Payment Leg of a Dividend Swap. Swap dividend payment rates. Earlier notes this behaves very like a variance swap but instead of betting in pure variance you take a bet on dividend. What practically in one of these: The difference between th ereal life dividend and the one you think it should be. so I say it should bte 2% over the next 10 years, so I swap 2% for the actual dividend amount So then there is one single payment at the end which nets these up. So in the above example ... they are usually 3 month or 6 month contracts, so if for instance th edividend if quarterly, there might be 2 dividends where the difference is netted up at the end.for example. (Us 1/4ly usually , Eur 6 months). Depends on the company&apos;s articles of association etc. e.g. Unilever is 6 mo)/ Structurally, Div Swap corr Swap and Var Swap are structured similarly, with one strike at the beginning. Strike may be expressed in terms of the (price) variance (the variance of the returns) , the correlation between typically 2 underlyers. or the dividend for each of these three types of swap respectively. 17 march Dividend is a flow based on a share, so is this not the same as a Return Swap in that the dividend is the return on the dividend? Also recall that with stocks themselves, there is no comitment by the issuer to pay the dividends.

        <rdfs:label>variance leg terms</rdfs:label>
        <skos:definition>A return which is driven by a Variance Calculation. Variance of a single price (over time - how is this modeled? Is this the duration of the contract or some defined period or poeriods of time). The variance gets its time basis from the negotiated period in the contract, e.g. Variance over 3 months. Check: Is this always the duration of the contract or can it be for example a set of time scales (say monthly) ove the life of say a 6 month contract, and take an average?? This is logically possible but we don&apos;t know if this is what this is. FpML: A type describing return which is driven by a Variance Calculation. More notes 17 Mar Varianc v covariance Variance is a surrogate for option. Talks about random fluctuation in prices If you look at options theory (black scholes) then the price of an option is 1rily dependent in variation in the price. The more variable the more expensive ot maintain a portfolio that is indifferent to the next move in price. So this Variance Swap allows you to extract that option price (i.e. the variance as above) into the variability of the underlying price. So then the asset being traded is in fact the asset that the price references. context: This is all about controlling the price of an asset (from the point of view of the portfolio holder). similarly with the variance on an index you are picking up on the generic market stability. Recall that an index is controlling an underlying portfolio, but with the index you talk directly about the price (in an index swap), this gives you control of a portfolio that is represented by that index. Basket Swap is this - difference is agreed basket (Index, which has a publisher) versus Basket where the &quot;index&quot; (we don&apos;t call it that here) is a basket of securities.</skos:definition>

        <skos:definition>A statistical leg based on covariance. REVIEW: This kmight specify the same kind of thing as Correlation Leg using different mathematics / different legal terms (in which case we need to model it as a different thing even though to the investor it has the same rationale and behavior. The relative movement of one thing to the other over a period of time. So this adds a time base to the Correlation calculation. difference with Correelation: The time base in correlation swap is implicit anyway (it&apos;s the duration of the contract. so Covariance is what allows you to explan x% of the vaqriabiltiy of the price of this asset with relation to that asset.</skos:definition>
