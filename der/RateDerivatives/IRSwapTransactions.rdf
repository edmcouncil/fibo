		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">Basis swap can be the same tenor but different indices e.g. 3 month LIBOR v 3 month TIBOR. Then the difference is not driven from a different interest rate period but from different markets, so I am swapping based on the difference in efficiency between the two markets. In cross ccy sense, would swap a Jap index for a US index. (is this a basis swap?) Protecting ourselves fom basis risk which is the difference in price between two markets. Review Conclusion: Basis swap is distinguished by being related to two markets. Floating Floating is also sometimes referred to as a Basis Swap as well though, but this is a different meaning (so we model it somewhere else). See also forward swap, as a means for controlling interest rate.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">This is made up of two legs which are made of the same stuff as a Funding Leg. IR Swap can be floating floating or fixed floating. The most common single ccy swap is the ficed v floating swap. In IR Markets we are talking about borrowing, so the legs can be thought of as a borrowing leg and a lending leg. In Equities etc. the Cash Leg is typically funding because you are looking to control the purchase or value of a non cash asset this is not the case here with these IR Swaps. FpML - just &quot;Swap&quot;.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
