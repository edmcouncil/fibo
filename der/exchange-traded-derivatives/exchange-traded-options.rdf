        <skos:definition>An option whose contract expires at a date longer than one year. Also known as long-term equity anticipation securities (LEAPS). From Investopedia: These options are called long-term equity anticipation securities (LEAPS). By providing opportunities to control and manage risk or even to speculate, LEAPS are virtually identical to regular options. LEAPS, however, provide these opportunities for much longer periods of time. Although they are not available on all stocks, LEAPS are available on most widely held issues.</skos:definition>

        <skos:definition>An Option Contract after the stage where a Derivatives Exchange has novated this contract and become the principal to it, for purposes of clearing and settlement. The Clearing House novates both contract. So when you are on the floor (as a Broker), you trade with another Broker. Then you take it to th eRing, and present it to the Ring. So you write a contract and give it to the ringleader, who then books it. So the party you dealt with deals with the exahcnge, and you deal with the exchange. THen there are two contracts for one deal. So the answer here is that there are two novated contracts for one Options deal. Difference: If not open outcry? In OO the deal is done and given to the ringleader, who represents the Cleaing house. When it&apos;s not open outcry, the clearing house gets the deal, books the deal, and margins it. So you don&apos;t know as much about the deal and process. This eliminiates stickiness of a market that has credit. Similar to what occurs in share markets, where clearing takes place, e.g. when someone defaults on delivery. Clearing House simply closes out the contract.</skos:definition>
