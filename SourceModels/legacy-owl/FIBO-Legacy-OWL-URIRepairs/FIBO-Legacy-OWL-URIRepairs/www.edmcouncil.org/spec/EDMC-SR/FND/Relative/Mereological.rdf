      <rdfs:label>Part</rdfs:label>
      <skos:definition>Something which is part of something else.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>This is defined in terms of what it is a part of. "Part" in the sense intended here is that which is defined explicitly as a part of something else. This is not the same as that which may in due course find itself to be part of something. Example: a wheel is an independent thing, which may form part of some vehicle, whereas "Nearside front wheel" is a term which is defined explicitly as a "Part". That is the sense intended here. Some care is required in applying this to models, otherwise inconsistencies will result.</skos:editorialNote>
