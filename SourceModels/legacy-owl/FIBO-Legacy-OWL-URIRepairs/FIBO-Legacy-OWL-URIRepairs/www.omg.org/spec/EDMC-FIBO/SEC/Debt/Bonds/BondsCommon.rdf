      <skos:definition>Terms, if any, by which a Debenture is secured. This is a description of the properties by which it is secured, being those not otherwise pledged.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>From original model (whose?): A debenture is usually unsecured in the sense that there are no liens or pledges on specific assets. It is however, secured by all properties not otherwise pledged. From Wikipedia A debenture (also called a note) is an unsecured corporate bond or a corporate bond that does not have a certain line of income or piece of property or equipment to guarantee repayment of principal upon the bond's maturity. Debentures are long-term debt instrument used by large companies to obtain funds. Where securities are offered, loan stocks or bonds are termed 'debentures' in the UK or 'mortgage bonds' in the US. Summary: Therefore they are unsecured in the sense of not having a particular cash flow allocated to them, but they are therefore secured by some other asset.</skos:editorialNote>

      <skos:definition>A Bond instrument which on maturity converts into an Equity instrument.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>There are different types based on the available exercise windows and facts thereof. Notes from CAE review on 7 July 2011 1. Convertible - meaning a convertible Bond whi ch converts into an Equity later in its life 2. Contingent Conversion (of what? - of a Debt. So it's a kind of Convertible) - if the share price reaches a particular threshold on a particular time window = COCO. - this is a debt instrument. you get the share when it reaches that price threshold. There are time windows (like traditional options instruments - i.e. Bermudan?) - is it mandatory to take a share it's mandatory - like a digital options which are also not really optional . The distinction is the time window.</skos:editorialNote>

   <owl:Class rdf:about="http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/SEC/Debt/Bonds/BondsCommon/Debenture">
      <rdfs:label>Debenture</rdfs:label>
      <skos:definition>A type of debt instrument that is not secured by physical asset or collateral. Debentures are backed only by the general creditworthiness and reputation of the issuer. Both corporations and governments frequently issue this type of bond in order to secure capital. Like other types of bonds, debentures are documented in an indenture.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>From Wikipedia: In law, a debenture is a document which either creates a debt or acknowledges it. It is a medium to long-term borrowing facility created by a company. Where repayment is secured by a charge over land, the document is called a 'mortgage'. Where repayment is secured by a charge other assets of the company, the document is called a 'debenture'. Where no security is involved, the document is called a note or 'unsecured deposit note'. There are two types of debentures: 1. Convertible Debentures, which are convertible bonds or bonds that can be converted into equity shares of the issuing company after a predetermined period of time. "Convertibility" is a feature that corporations may add to the bonds they issue in order to make them more attractive to buyers. In other words, it is a special feature that a corporate bond may carry. As a result of the advantage a buyer gets from the ability to convert, convertible bonds typically have lower interest rates than non-convertible corporate bonds. 2. Non-Convertible Debentures, which are simply regular debentures, cannot be converted into equity shares of the liable company. They are debentures without the convertibility feature attached to them. As a result, they usually carry higher interest rates than their convertible counterparts.</skos:editorialNote>

   <owl:Class rdf:about="http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/SEC/Debt/Bonds/BondsCommon/MediumTermNote">
      <rdfs:label>Medium Term Note</rdfs:label>
      <skos:definition>A Medium Term Note is a Negotiable debt instrument offered under a program agreement through one or more dealers upon request of the Issuer. The Program defines the terms and conditions of the notes. An MTN issue is defined by the fact that the registration doesn't have a pre-defined maturity.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>MTNs have a maturity typically of 1 to 10 years. This may vary in different jurisductions. Bonds issued with a long maturity are not redefined as MTNs when their maturity reduces. MTN typically has a long last coupon payment. Some things are different from regular bonds, e.g.: You can register one with different maturities, issued in different groups (cf tranches). See also shelf registration (issuing bond before you file the paperwork with e.g. SEC - not the same). In this case it is registered but not issued all at one time. Flexible. Difference with bond issuance is that you have indenture that says what the maturity is, so every different maturity is a different bond.</skos:editorialNote>
