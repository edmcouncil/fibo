      <skos:definition>The Debt Instrument Pool Constituent is a Tradable Debt Security.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>This may be a slice of some tranche of a tranched debt security issue. Modeling note: Debt instruments are pooled in order to pool the debt that they represent. Whereas for pools of individual loans these are modeled as the loan debt, here we model the pool of debt instruments as the pool of contracts which are the instruments themselves, for ease of reference. The security is a contract which embodoes the terms and conditions for the securitized debt but also effectively stand in for the debt itself, i.e. a pool is described in all data models in terms of the constituents, as security contracts with CUSIP or other security identifier, and it is understood that in pooling these contracts one is pooling the debt they stand for. A more literal approach is taken in this model for loan and mortgage pools, meaning that they two kinds of pool constituents are modeled differently. To indicate this, we have given this Constituent term two parents: A constituent which is a pool of securities; and a constituent which is a pool of debt. The latter being a pool either of loans or of debt securities.</skos:editorialNote>

For example, the pool might be a fund or a debt SPV which is formed by each of the participants extending credit to that pool and holding bond units in the pool representing that debt. Most recent iteration of the model distinguishes between monies owed at any point in time i.e. a dated term (Debt), and debt issued or drawn down at one specific point and paid off thereafter under defined terms (loan products and securitizated debt, also widely referred to as debt but labeled otherwise in this model). The present term appears to fall under the latter category of term. Or the term may now be redundant.</skos:editorialNote>
