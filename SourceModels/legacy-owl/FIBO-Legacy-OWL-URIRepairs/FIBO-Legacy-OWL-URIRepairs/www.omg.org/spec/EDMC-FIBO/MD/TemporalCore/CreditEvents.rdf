      <skos:editorialNote>ISDA has combinations of credit event types. These are: Bankruptcy Failure to pay principal Failure to pay interest Obligation Default Obligation Acceleration Repudiation / Moratorium Distressed Ratings Downgrade Maturity Extension Writedown Not yes/no: Restructuring (Restructuring structure) Failure to Pay (Failure to Pay structure) Default Requirement (Monetary Amount) - applies to: Obligation Acceleration, Obligation Default, Repudiation/Moratorium, Restructuring Credit Event notice (Notice) Review note: term not in FpML, called Failure to Repair event (May equate to ISDA "Failure To Pay") Conclusion: It is the same thing. Added as synonym Modeling note: Note that some of these are simple "Yes/no" conditions i.e. the event has happened or it has not. Others comprise more detailed information. However, 4 of those that are given as "yes/no" in FpML do in fact have the additional fact of Default Requirement. So almost none are simple yes/no or list entry terms. Modeled accordingly. Note also that the term Credit Event is defined more widely than just in CDS, for example in credit indices or just as business events generally. Therefore some of the CDS-specific terms here won't apply in those other contexts. Review comment: 22 styles of ISDA agreements for CDS as well, with different combinations of terms.

      <skos:editorialNote>This credit event corresponds to a failure to pay principal or interest after the applicable grace period, and is therefore not the common super-type of Failue to pay Interst and Failure to pay Principal - those are simple missed payments.

      <skos:definition>An event which relates specifically to an individual security issued by the Reference Entity (the Reference Obligation).</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>From inspection of the ISDA definitions it is clear that some Credit Events relate to a business entity (legal entity since it is incurring debts) while others relate specifically to an individual instrument. The distinction may be of minor interest in practice since most entities would presumably only have one debt instrument in issue. This term added to pick up the explicit relationship to the Reference Obligation for these Credit Event types. The others are deemed to relate to the Reference Entity directly and to the Reference Obligation by extension.</skos:editorialNote>
