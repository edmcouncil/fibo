      <rdfs:label>Average Life</rdfs:label>
      <skos:definition>An estimate of the number of terms to maturity, taking the possibility of early payments into account. Average life is calculated using the weighted average time to the receipt of all future cash flows.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>Where it refers to pre-payment above, if the bond does not include prepayment then this is not included. However, analytics that refer to this e.g. Yield to Average Life, then this figure is relevant. It is not relevant for other types of bond where e.g. you would use yield to next call, yield to worst etc. Average Life used in place of Maturity for Yield Calculation. This is not only used for Yield calculations though. It is referred to as an analytic figure in its own right. Average Life uses one of a number of standard pre-payment models (for structured finance at least). For MBS, the average life includes some calculations to take account of pre-payments on the underlying mortgages. This takes account of the possibillity of borrowers paying early. This has to be modeled or forecast (not given) as it's a function of market conditions and interest rate. You would not see this in a market data feed. When you model MBS you calculate Average Life as part of the model i.e. you estimate the percentage of prepayment in the next x length of time and factor this into the Average Life. Refers to Weighted Average Time to receipt of future cash flows. For MBS, early payments will shorten the Average Life. For Student Loans, Credit Card, Loan etc, i.e. all Pool Backed (any bond that has securitized debt). Other bonds: Sinking Funds etc., also Early Payment - partial Call for a corporate / regular bond. Early Payment for pass through has the same effect. Sinking Fund: Each payment is part principal and part interest, this is implicit in the overall definition of "Early payment".</skos:editorialNote>

      <rdfs:label>Debt Convexity Analytic</rdfs:label>
      <skos:definition>The second derivative of a security's price with respect to its yield, divided by the security's price. A security exhibits positive convexity when its price rises more for a downward move in its yield than its price declines for an equal upward move in its yield. Further notes: A measure of the change in price for a given change in Modified Duration. This always (necessarily) refers to Modified Duration. This is used as another risk measurement. Numerator is always (a) duration - either MacCaulays or Modified. Always rate of change of (one of the) Duration against some other parameter. The other paramater can be characterised as a Yield (it may be the Price, but that has a relationship to the Yield in any case). REVIEW: Inconsistency in the above - is it always necessarily Modified Duration that is referred to, or "any" Duration measure (Macaulays and.or Modified)? notes 9 Dec A measure of the sensitivity of the price with reference to interest rates. This is normally determined with reference to maturity, but since there are different maturity dates, this figure gives an estimate of the equitvalent if you had a homogenous portfolio, i.e. this is an estimate based on a pure equivalent, homogenous portfolio. Convexity of instrument versus portfolio. Sees instrument in terms of the set of cashflows. The term Convexity can be applied either to a bond or to a portfolio. More notes: When you get Convexit in MD, it will tell you what Duration it is refrfering to, along with Redemption Date (logically). Also if there is Option Adjusted Yield, there is a third set of analytics. What are they? i.e. OA Convexity, Duration Yield and the rest. Conclusions: Agreed to revisit this in OTC.</skos:definition>

      <skos:editorialNote>Duration in general is a measure of % price change for a given change in yield. See definition from BMB The duration on a traditional bond will be much shorter than the duration relative to the maturity. Duration is the first derivative of the curve between Price and Yield. There are multiple types of duration, all of which are variants of this. So Duration is the first derivative and the different type of duration measure are different ways of measuring this, for example a "quick and dirty" measure of duration or one which.</skos:editorialNote>

      <skos:definition>A dollar-weighted average measuring the age of the individual loans in a mortgage pass-through or pooled security, such as Ginnie Mae or a Freddie Mac security. The WALA is measured as the time in months since the origination of the loans, with the weighting based on each loan's size in proportion to the aggregate total of the pool.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>This is defined by the issuer. WALA is more official, not an analysis from a vendor. This changes but the values are relayed by the issuer on an ongoing basis. Investopedia explains Weighted Average Loan Age - WALA The weighted average age will change over time as some mortgages get paid off faster than others. Based on the issuer of the mortgage-backed securities (MBS), the WALA may be weighted on the remaining principal balance dollar figure, or the beginning notional value of the loan. The flip side of the WALA is the weighted average maturity (WAM), which is a dollar-weighted measure of the months remaining until the principal amounts are completely repaid on each loan in the pool.</skos:editorialNote>

      <skos:definition>The weighted average of the time until all maturities on mortgages in a mortgage-backed security (MBS).

Synonym (if this is the same term): Also known as "average effective maturity".</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>Investopedia explains Weighted Average Maturity - WAM The measure is calculated by totaling each mortgage value represented by the MBS. The weights of each mortgage is found by dividing the value of each into the total of all. To arrive at the WAM number the weight of each security is multiplied by the time until maturity of each mortgage, and then all the values are added together. For example say an MBS has three mortgages valued at $1,000, $2,000 and $3,000 (a total of $6,000) and mature in one, two and three years respectively. The weights of these are 1/6 (1,000/6,000), 1/3 (2,000/6,000) and 1/2 (3,000/6,000). The WAM is 2 1/3 years (1/6 x 1 year + 1/3 x 2 years + 1/2 x 3 years). Analysis: this investopedia decription does not take account of there being more than one Pool behind the MBS.</skos:editorialNote>

      <skos:definition>The rate at which the pool is paying down. Further Notes 02 Dec: This is a model. Includes other factors such as homogeniety. Earlier notes: Same as Payment. Curtailment. Paydown is normally scheduled payments of the mortgage. Prepayment is when someone pays off the mortgage early I may send in 1500 when my monthly amount is 1000 a month. So the 500 is a prepayment. Scheduled principal payment. More notes 25 nov: Also factor in changes to the pool constituents where this is allowed for that kind of MBS. So we make estimates of how face value will will change. face value won't change but the underlying value of the Pf changes, so eg. the current mortgage factor. Model update note June 2010: Detailed types of "Prepayment Speed" analytic received from thomson Reuters, now modeled as sub types of this term. So term origin is PSA by extension, since this is the common super class of 3 specific prepayment speed analytic types defined by PSA. PSA stands for Public Securities Association. Type: PSA gives this as numeric, however definitions imply percentage, so defined as dated percentage for now. Many data models use numbers which are interpreted later as percentages so this may be the case here.</skos:definition>
