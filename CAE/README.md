# Corporate Actions and Events (CAE)

This directory contains ontologies belonging to the Corporate Actions and Events (CAE) domain. This domain contains ontologies that define events and actions that may occur during the life of a security, and are typically those events which may cause some change in some part of the underlying reference information for that security. Corporate actions include actions that require some action on the part of the holder, and in these and some other cases, there are process descriptions for the flow of activities involved.
