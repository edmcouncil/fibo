        <skos:definition>Some commitment which has its existence through some provision in some contract. Further notes: &quot;Contractual commitment&quot; has 2 tests: 1. It is certain in time [certainty is defined in some legal sense; there has to be some ability to terminate the contract] 2. there is some consideration Without these 2 tests passing, this is not recognized in law as a contractual commitment. so for instance a Will is not legally binding upon a person who is alive. (from Aus / commonwealth law) NB: Terminating: Not the termination of a contract in a Termination Clause but the termination of the life of the Obligation as set out in the contract.</skos:definition>
