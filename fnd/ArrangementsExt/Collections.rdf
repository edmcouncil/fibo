		<dct:abstract>This ontology extends the concept of Collection that exists in the published Release Arrangements ontology, to define the notion of a constituent and its membership of the collection. This is intended to be referred to in models of baskets and other collections of things in the financial world, in order to be able to talk about the inclusion or otherwise of some instrument in some basket or similar construct.</dct:abstract>

It differs from a less formal collection in that there are facts defined about the constituents and the proportions of these in the collection, and specific facts about that item as a member of that collection. Constituents are defined for Pools and for Baskets.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

Further notes: Some kinds of collection are defined in terms of collections of relative things (e.g. basket constituents) with qualifying facts, while others may be defined simply as sets of independent things. It is also possible to have a collection of collections. This is covered by the identity criterion for the Constituent being any Independent Thing, including Collection.</skos:definition>
