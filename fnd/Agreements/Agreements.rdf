Agreements as defined here are the actual agreements between parties, and this ontology is intended to be referred to in conjunction with the contracts ontology which defines the actual contracts which formalize such agreements. The concepts of agreement and contract are intended to be kept distinct in the FIBO ontologies, that is neither is intended to be regarded as a sub type of the other.</sm:fileAbstract>

			rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Agreements/Agreements.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.
   (6) to revise a few of the definitions based on more formal sources.</skos:changeNote>
