If the offeree acts on the offeror&apos;s promise, the offeror is legally obligated to fulfill the contract, but an offeree cannot be forced to act (or not act), because no return promise has been made to the offeror. After an offeree has performed, only one enforceable promise exists, that of the offeror.

Scope Note: One thing to tease out is whether &amp;quot;Dispute Resolution&amp;quot; and other forms of &amp;quot;Governing Law&amp;quot; are one and the same thing or not. Dispute Resolution is uncontroversial, the question is whether there are other implications to Governing Law or if it&apos;s the same thing. For instance I may undertake to behave as though I were responsible to a particular authority i.e. a particular set of statutes.</skos:editorialNote>
