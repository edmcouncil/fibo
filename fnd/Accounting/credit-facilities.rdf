        <rdfs:label>tranche purpose</rdfs:label>
        <skos:definition>The purpose for which the Tranche may exist. Notes 10 Feb: Question: What about a website that offers facilities for multiple purposes? Sometimes facility and purpose are not kept distinct. Differences: Retail lending - as modeled here commercial lending - see notes Purpose - Specific lenders e.g. Sallie Mae: Is it a loan or a credit facility? Is it structured similar to Construction / project loan? May look like multiple loans but these are fungible so it looks like one loan? Semantically: Facility v Loan? Student loan: usually for no more than one year. Would have multiple loans, so e.g. 2 or 3 semesters. School sets up number of disbursements so that tan equal amount goes at the start of a given semestrer. Next year you apply again for the loan AND before that you reassess the credit worthiness, so this means you are applying for a new Credit Facility Tranche as defined here. Always treated as a separate loan. School also has to certify that loan. See status - schol status, grace period status. Defer, small fixed, etc. versus full P&amp;I which applies when they have left school May be 10 years or so. Would be separate loans, but pulled into one bull group, with one payment. May be a min payment amount to be applied abgainst each loan, say min $50 per payment, based upon the Program. Is the Program a facility?? Or should we regard it as a kind of pool of loans, with a single repayment schedule. Account? Consolidation. The individual doesn&apos;t have to see loads of statements.</skos:definition>

        <skos:definition>Further Notes See detailed notes elseherw 14 July. We now have it that all loans follow from a CommittedCredit Facility, but this may be transient. See notes on fees and Ts and Cs. See also FpML terms and elements on this. Apply to loan, draw-down generally (money market loan where we only see the actual lending). Is there also this feature in Money Markets, if you go straight to the market and they assess you on the spot? They have simply done the same kind of assessment. So maybe the concept of transient Cr facility tranche does not apply in that instance. There need be no firm commitment until the instrument is bought off you, at which point you have the capital. So this is where money markets and loans part company. Lending departments: create facility Money markets: deliver the money.</skos:definition>
