		<rdfs:label>People Ontology</rdfs:label>
		<dct:abstract>This ontology defines concepts for people and human related terms, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. People as defined here are human persons only. This ontology sets out a number of basic properties which are held by people or are definitive of a small number of specific types of people such as minors or adults. Primary use cases for determining the set of personal information definitions included are the common elements required to (1) open a bank account, (2) identify a sophisticated investor, and (3) establish foreign account ownership for money laundering purposes.</dct:abstract>

		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20160201/AgentsAndPeople/People.rdf version of the ontology was was modified per the FIBO 2.0 RFC, including integration of LCC.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/AgentsAndPeople/People.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.
   (6) to revise and extend the set of properties about people required to fulfill the set of use cases listed above.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20130801/AgentsAndPeople/People.rdf version of the ontology was was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.0 FTF report and in https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/1.0/AboutFND-1.0/. It was further revised in the FTF in advance of the Long Beach meeting, resulting in https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20141101/AgentsAndPeople/People/.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20141101/AgentsAndPeople/People.rdf version of the ontology was was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.1 RTF report, primarily to use the hasAddress property in addresses, and change PostalAddress to PhysicalAddress in a restriction on Person. Also revised the identifiesAddress property in favor of verifiesAddress, and revised hasDateofBirth with respect to an identity document to be verifiesDateOfBirth, which was determined to be more appropriate by the RTF.</skos:changeNote>

Most countries accept passports as a form of identification.  Most countries have the rule that foreign citizens need to have their passport or occasionally a national identity card from their country available at any time if they do not have residence permit in the country.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:adaptedFrom rdf:datatype="&xsd;anyURI">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_identification_number</fibo-fnd-utl-av:adaptedFrom>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>A national identification number, national identity number, or national insurance number is used by the governments of many countries as a means of tracking their citizens, permanent residents, and temporary residents for the purposes of work, taxation, government benefits, health care, and other governmentally-related functions. The number will appear on an identity document issued by a country.

The ways in which such a system is implemented are dependent on the country, but in most cases, a citizen is issued an identification number at birth or when they reach a legal age (typically the age of 18). Non-citizens may be issued such numbers when they enter the country, or when granted a temporary or permanent residence permit.

Many countries issued such numbers ostensibly for a singular purpose, but over time, they become a de facto national identification number. For example, the United States originally developed its Social Security number system as a means of disbursing Social Security benefits. However, due to function creep, the number has become utilized for other purposes to the point where it is almost essential to have one to, among other things, open a bank account, obtain a credit card, or drive a car.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
