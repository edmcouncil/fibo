		<skos:definition xml:lang="en">An area within a country or state, designated by that country or state as a County for its own descriptive and administrative purposes. Fiurther Notes: Specific properties of counties will vary from one country or state to another and are not erpresented here - this is purely a labelled area of land within a country, similar to a Region.</skos:definition>

		<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">geographical area</rdfs:label>
		<skos:definition xml:lang="en">A named and formally defined area of the world defined in terms of its physical extent. Scope Note: A Geographical Area is both a Geographical Feature (some named physical location on Earth) and a Geophysical Location (having two-dimensional extent on the Earth&apos;s surface).</skos:definition>

		<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&fibo-fnd-plc-loc;PhysicalLocation"/>
		<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">geographical feature</rdfs:label>
		<skos:definition xml:lang="en">Some named physical location on Earth, identified geographically such as a specific land area, city or geographical feature. Scope Note: This is usually an alternative way of describing some geophysical extent or location, for example describing a city as a city as distinct from describing the physical extent of that city. Many concepts may therefore extend from this and from Geophysical or Geospatial concepts. For many purposes, modelers may ignore this class. Scope Note: This differs from Geophysical Location in that may include geographical features identified as points on the Earth&apos;s surface, or as linear features such as rivers and shorelines.</skos:definition>

		<skos:definition xml:lang="en">Some physical two dimensional extent on the surface of the Earth. Scope Note: The definition given in the FIBO Foundations specification for Physical Location defines some n- e.g. three dimensional space. This concept extends this to define a two dimensional extent on the Earth or other planets. Explanatory Note: Some of these locations may also be co-extensive with Geographical Features, the latter being named geophysical lications.</skos:definition>

		<skos:definition xml:lang="en">Some physical two dimensional extent on the surface of some planet or natural satellite. Scope Note: The definition given in the FIBO Foundations specification for Physical Location defines some n- e.g. three dimensional space. This concept extends this to define a two dimensional extent on the Earth or other planets, moons etc. Scope Note: Potential specializations of this concept would include areographical locations (on Mars) and other planetographahical features. These are not in scope for FIBO but this abstraction has been included so that models which do explore that scope may be compatible with this model.
