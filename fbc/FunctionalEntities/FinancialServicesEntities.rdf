        <fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 defines a bank as any depository financial intermediary that accepts checking accounts (checks) or makes commercial loans, and its deposits are insured by a federal deposit insurance agency.  A bank acts as a middleman between suppliers of funds and users of funds, substituting its own credit judgement for that of the ultimate suppliers of funds, collecting those funds from three sources: checking accounts, savings and time deposits; short-term borrowings from other banks; and equity capital. A bank earns money by reinvesting these funds in longer-term assets.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
        <fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">A bank, as specified in the Investment Company Act of 1940, is a financial intermediary that is (a) a depository institution (as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) or a branch or agency of a foreign bank (as such terms are defined in section 1(b) of the International Banking Act of 1978), (b) a member bank of the Federal Reserve System, (c) any other banking institution or trust company, whether incorporated or not, doing business under the laws of any State or of the United States, a substantial portion of the business of which consists of receiving deposits or exercising fiduciary powers similar to those permitted to national banks under the authority of the Comptroller of the Currency, and which is supervised and examined by State or Federal authority having supervision over banks, and which is not operated for the purpose of evading the provisions of this title, and (d) a receiver, conservator, or other liquidating agent of any institution or firm included in clause (a), (b), or (c) of this paragraph.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
        <fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">A state bank is defined as any bank, banking association, trust company, savings bank, industrial bank (or similar depository institution operating substantially in the same manner as an industrial bank), or other banking institution which is engaged in the business of receiving deposits other than trust funds, and in the US, is incorporated under the laws of any State or which is operating under the Code of Law for the District of Columbia, including any cooperative bank or other unincorporated bank the deposits of which were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on the day before the date of the enactment of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

        <fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">According to the FFIEC, a bank holding company is a company that owns and/or controls one or more U.S. banks or one that owns, or has controlling interest in, one or more banks. A bank holding company may also own another bank holding company, which in turn owns or controls a bank; the company at the top of the ownership chain is called the top holder. The Board of Governors is responsible for regulating and supervising bank holding companies, even if the bank owned by the holding company is under the primary supervision of a different federal agency (OCC or FDIC).</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

Common forms of insurance include life, property and casualty, and health insurance. In addition to insuring against hazards, many insurance companies also sell investments or investment-like products. The most prevalent investment products offered by insurers are annuities and life insurance policies that also feature investment elements.

A number of insurance companies operate brokerage arms that trade securities on behalf of clients.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
