OTFs are intended to be similar in scope to a swap execution facility (SEF), a type of entity created by the Dodd-Frank Act in the U.S. The goal of SEFs and OTFs is to bring transparency and structure to OTC derivatives trading.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>Unlike RMs and MTFs, operators of OTFs will have discretion as to how to execute orders, subject to pre-transparency and best execution obligations.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
