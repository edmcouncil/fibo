		<dct:abstract>Concepts common to asset backed and mortgage backed securities, including pools, instruments, prospectuses and deals common concepts. 
		Note that in common industry parlance, the term &apos;asset backed security&apos; is used to refer to securities which specifically do not have a mortgage loan pool as their underlying asset. For this reason, this ontology provides a common parent to both asset backed and mortgage backed securities, which is effectively an asset backed security in the broader sense. This has been labeled as &apos;pool backed security instrument&apos; as there is no common industry name for this common parent class, other than &apos;asset backed security&apos;.</dct:abstract>

		<skos:definition xml:lang="en">The issue of a series of Pool Backed Security certificates. These are (at least in this context) securities issued backed by a pool of individual loans, mortgages or other individual loan products.</skos:definition>
		<skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">This term makes the distinction, perhaps artificial, between deals backed by pools of individual debt (this term), and deals backed by pools of securities (collateralized deals). This structure of relations between kinds of deals may prove to be a little artificial, but it reflects the structure of relations between kinds of securities, arrived at in earlier SME reviews. That is, Pool Backed Security (which breaks down into ABS and MBS) has a pool of individual loan products (a sub type of which is mortgage loans). The terms reflect the fact that in common parlance the term &quot;ABS&quot; is taken to mean something which is explicitly NOT a MBS but can be any other type of loan or credit based security, hence the creation of the non standard term &quot;Pool Backed Security&quot;. The naming of deals simply attempts to reflect that. Terms to be included in Deal (per PoC conversations): Underwriters Issuer Deal Number Series number Deal Value Different collateral pools that support the deal. Review existing terms and make sure all covered.</skos:editorialNote>
