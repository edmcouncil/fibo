A prime feature of most municipal securities is that interest or other investment earnings on them are generally excluded from gross income of the bondholder for federal income tax purposes. Some municipal securities are subject to federal income tax, although the issuers or bondholders may receive other federal tax advantages for certain types of taxable municipal securities.

If any bond so selected is redeemed, the Calculation Agent will select a new Fallback Bond on the same basis, but selected from all eligible bonds in issue at the time the original Fallback Bond is redeemed (including any bond for which the redeemed bond is exchanged). Note the rate of the fallback bond is used as a substitute for the inflation index if, for example, it is no longer published.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
