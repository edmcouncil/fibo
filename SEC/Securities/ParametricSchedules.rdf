		<skos:editorialNote>FpML definition: &quot;Per 2000 ISDA Definitions, Section 4.11, FRN Convention, Eurodollar Convention.&quot; The above definition is from FpML and does not give the meaning or nature of this rule. FpML notes that this is not strictly a Date Roll Rule (but it may be selected in place of one). On inspection of the ISDA 2000 definition text, this may be because the FRN rule contains within it a specification of the Modified Following date roll rule (Date following rule modified by Modification rule). This rule appears in FpML both in the BusinessDayConventionEnum and the RollConventionEnum (for date roll rules and for scheduled event dates respectively). From FpML definition for BusinessDayConventionEnum: &quot;... Note that FRN is included here as a type of business day convention although it does not strictly fall within ISDA&apos;s definition of a Business Day Convention and does not conform to the simple definition given above.&quot; Note that this FRN rule is also included in the FpML enumeration for &quot;RollConventionEnum&quot;. This is the enumeration of possible Calculation Period End Dates and uses the word &quot;Roll&quot; in a completely different sense (the date that the application of some calculation to some amount is rolled over from one rate to the next). Full definition from ISDA 2000 Section 4.11: Section 4.11. FRN Convention; Eurodollar Convention. &quot;FRN Convention&quot; or &quot;Eurodollar Convention&quot; means, in respect of either Payment Dates or Period End Dates for a Swap Transaction and a party, that the Payment Dates or Period End Dates of that party will be each day during the Term of the Swap Transaction that numerically corresponds to the preceding applicable Payment Date or Period End Date, as the case may be, of that party in the calendar month that is the specified number of months after the month in which the preceding applicable Payment Date or Period End Date occurred (or, in the case of the first applicable Payment Date or the Period End Date, the day that numerically corresponds to the Effective Date in the calendar month that is the specified number of months after the month in which the Effective Date occurred), except that (a) if there is not any such numerically corresponding day in the calendar month in which a Payment Date or Period End Date, as the case may be, of that party should occur, then the Payment Date or Period End Date will be the last day that is a Business Day in that month, (b) if a Payment Date or Period End Date, as the case may be, of the party would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day, then the Payment Date or Period End Date will be the first following day that is a Business Day unless that day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the Payment Date or Period End Date will be the first preceding day that is a Business Day and (c) if the preceding applicable Payment Date or Period End Date, as the case may be, of that party occurred on the last day in a calendar month that was a Business Day, then all subsequent applicable Payment Dates or Period End Dates, as the case may be, of that party prior to the Termination Date will be the last day that is a Business Day in the month that is the specified number of months after the month in which the preceding applicable Payment Date or Period End Date occurred.</skos:editorialNote>

		<rdfs:label>parametric schedule</rdfs:label>
		<skos:definition>a regular, parameterized schedule typically used for the calculation of payments for coupons, dividends, and interest</skos:definition>
		<skos:editorialNote>This is a schedule for one of the events that occur in a periodic schedule of interest accruals, interest payments, and (for floating rate swapstreams), changes to the interest rate. These may be specified individually but more commonly the Calculation event is the one scheduled according to this kind of parametric schedule, with the other dates specified as an offset to these. Here we have allowed for each of the related dates to be independently parametrically scheduled. The notional amount step schedule is a separate kind of schedule, with similar terms but without a period length. For calculation schedules (and possibly payments, resets), there is a different end date to the end /start of the period, since events may be specified as being on specific dates - this is where the Roll Convention comes in. This has the same basic concepts as the generic schedule shown as the parent to this. However, where the upper model has Date with various applicable sub types (known i.e. calendar, specified or determined). For example, an ISDA FpML schedule has a Specified Date (via a convention), and then has a date roll rule which is specified for the whole schedule and applies to each of the dates returned by the parametric specification of the schedule. It has: A schedule beginning and end; A set of regular repeating periods: the scheduled event takes place once per period; Optionally one or two stubs (one start and one end); these may be longer than the repeating period, or shorter. The precise parameters used are: Start of the overall Schedule period: Effective Date End of the overall Schedule period: Termination Date Start of first regular period: not specified (assume Effective Date?) Length of each regular period: Frequency (actually a duration) There are generally three ways in which the regular periods of a parametric schedule may be expressed: first plus last first plus period length last plus period length event date plus period length. In FpML, Roll events (the date that something rolls over from the value used in one period to the value used in the next) is defined in a Roll Convention, which may be a day of the month, a day of the week, or some published set of dates, typically the ISDA quarterly dates for these events. This is therefore the date within the regular period (before adjustments) when the event occurs. This is in addition so a date for the start or end of such a period. In general this applies to the Calculation Schedule (i.e. the event is the calculation event) with other dates specified relative to this, however in principle the other related events (payment and reset or refix) are specified relative to this. It is not immediately clear what specification of a date replaces the Roll event convention element when this happens.</skos:editorialNote>
