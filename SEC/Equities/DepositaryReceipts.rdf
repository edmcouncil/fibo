		<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">American depositary receipt</rdfs:label>
		<skos:definition xml:lang="en">depositary receipt that represents securities of a foreign company and allows that company&apos;s shares to trade in the U.S. financial markets</skos:definition>
		<skos:example xml:lang="en">For example, Accton Technology is traded on the Taiwanese exchange.  In order for Accton Technology to be traded in the United States, Citibank, acting as a domestic custodian bank, purchases shares of Accton Technology and creates a security, ISIN US00437R1032, which can be traded on a U.S. exchange, in this case PORTAL.  Note that the depositary shares do not have to equal the number of original shares.  In the case of Accton Technology, one depositary share is equivalent to two original shares.</skos:example>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:abbreviation xml:lang="en">ADR</fibo-fnd-utl-av:abbreviation>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">Each ADR is issued by a domestic custodian bank when the underlying shares are deposited in a foreign depositary bank, usually by a broker who has purchased the shares in the open market local to the foreign company.  An ADR can represent a fraction of a share, a single share, or multiple shares of a foreign security.  The holder of an ADR has the right to obtain the underlying foreign security that the ADR represents, but investors usually find it more convenient to own the ADR. The price of an ADR generally tracks the price of the foreign security in its home market, adjusted for the ratio of ADRs to foreign company shares. In the case of companies domiciled in the United Kingdom, creation of ADRs attracts a 1.5 percent creation fee; this creation fee is different than stamp duty reserve tax charge by the UK government. Depositary banks have various responsibilities to ADR holders and to the issuing foreign company the ADR represents.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

		<skos:definition xml:lang="en">depositary receipt that is established without the company&apos;s cooperation</skos:definition>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">For an unsponsored ADR, a depository entity can issue certificates when there&apos;s heavy demand from investors for ownership in a specific company from abroad. The issuing entity is normally a broker-dealer that owns common stock in the company. Because they&apos;re issued without the consent or cooperation of the foreign company, unsponsored ADRs generally trade over-the-counter (OTC)—rather than on a stock exchange. Also, shareholder benefits and voting rights may not be extended to the holders of these particular securities. Many large global corporations use unsponsored ADRs to attract American capital. For example, American investors can invest in Royal Mail PLC, a postal and delivery service company from the United Kingdom that was founded by Henry VIII. The company&apos;s unsponsored ADR trades OTC under the ticker symbol ROYMY.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
