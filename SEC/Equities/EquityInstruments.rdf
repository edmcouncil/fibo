		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/20180801/Equities/EquityInstruments.rdf version of this ontology was revised to replace &apos;publicly-traded share&apos; with &apos;exchange-specific share&apos;, which is the more commonly used designation and corresponds better with the intended semantics of this concept, to merge in concepts that were formerly in a separate ShareTerms ontology, and eliminate deprecated elements.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/20190901/Equities/EquityInstruments.rdf version of this ontology was revised to refine the definition of listed share, update definitions to remove leading articles, add missing properties and restrictions, revise the definition of dividend.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/20191201/Equities/EquityInstruments.rdf version of this ontology was revised to refine the definition of share to include a restriction for hasSharesOutstanding, eliminate duplication of concepts in LCC, and add the concept of an equity issuer.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/20200301/Equities/EquityInstruments.rdf version of this ontology was revised to incorporate additional features required to map the CFI classification scheme to equity instruments, including features specific to preferred shares.</skos:changeNote>

		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/20201201/Equities/EquityInstruments.rdf version of this ontology was revised to add concepts covering additional features of preferred shares, move the two exhaustive CFI-specific classes to the Equity CFI individuals ontology, rename EquityIssuer to ShareIssuer to be clearer about the intent, and add the concept of a price per share.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/20210301/Equities/EquityInstruments.rdf version of this ontology was revised to rename ownership related properties for consistent alignment with the ownership situational pattern and to move properties / restrictions that define how many shares have been issued from the issuer to the share.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/20210601/Equities/EquityInstruments.rdf version of this ontology was revised to revise the definition of dividend to explicitly state that it reflects the announced commitment of a specific dividend rather than a more general policy.</skos:changeNote>

		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/20220501/Equities/EquityInstruments.rdf version of this ontology was revised to address text formatting hygiene issues.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/20220801/Equities/EquityInstruments.rdf version of this ontology was revised to add the notion of a VIE share and integrate dividend distribution method with strategy.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/20221001/Equities/EquityInstruments.rdf version of the ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) Annotation Vocabulary rather than the OMG&apos;s Specification Metadata vocabulary.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/20230201/Equities/EquityInstruments.rdf version of this ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) rather than the OMG&apos;s Languages, Countries and Codes (LCC), eliminating redundancies in FIBO as appropriate.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/20230301/Equities/EquityInstruments.rdf version of this ontology was modified to clarify a restriction on perpetual preferred share, add extendible preferred share, and add the CFI definition for limited partnership unit.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/20230601/Equities/EquityInstruments.rdf version of the ontology was modified to eliminate deprecations that are more than 6 months old and to replace content that is now available in the OMG Commons Ontology Library (Commons) v1.1 (FND-380).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/20231201/Equities/EquityInstruments.rdf version of the ontology was modified to replace content that is now available in the OMG Commons Ontology Library (Commons) v1.1 (FND-380) and to clean up details related to regular schedules (FBC-317).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/20240301/Equities/EquityInstruments.rdf version of the ontology was modified to add a link to the formula used to calculate an adjustable rate dividend and loosen some constraints to make the ontology more useful in cases where one could have information about a preferred share, such as having an adjustable rate dividend, but not necessarily having the details (SEC-138).</skos:changeNote>
