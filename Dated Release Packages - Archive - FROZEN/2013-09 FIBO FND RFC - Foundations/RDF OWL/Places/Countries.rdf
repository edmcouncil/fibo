        <sm:specificationAbstract rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">FIBO Foundations is a set of business concepts which are intended to support the financial industry terms semantics presented in other FIBO specifications.  

The FIBO Foundations models define concepts which are not unique to the financial services industry. From these, financial industry terms in other FIBO specifications may be derived by extension. Terms are also included which may be referred to by properties of things in those specifications. FIBO Foundations therefore includes a number of basic terms about legal, contractual and organizational concepts, among others. </sm:specificationAbstract>

        <skos:historyNote rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">This version of the FIBO Foundations Specification was revised primarily to reflect comments received at the March 2013 OMG Technical Meeting in Reston and reflected in the Errata discussed at the June 2013 OMG Technical Meeting in Berlin. 

Revisions to FIBO Foundations are managed per the process outlined in the Policies and Procedures for OMG standards, with the intent to maintain backwards compatibility in the ontologies to the degree possible.
  
The RDF/XML serialized OWL for the Foundations ODM/OWL ontologies have been checked for syntactic errors and logical consistency with Protege 4 (http://protege.stanford.edu/), HermiT 1.3.7 (http://www.hermit-reasoner.com/) and Pellet 2.2 (http://clarkparsia.com/pellet/).</skos:historyNote>

        <sm:fileAbstract rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">This ontology provides a very high level definition of country related concepts, essentially a placeholder for use in mapping countries and intra-country concepts to the appropriate regional standards or to some as yet undefined global address ontology, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. A minimal set of geopolitical and geophysical terms are included as required for financial risk management and other application use cases, and these are all to be considered as placeholders for suitable standard ontologies for these concepts as these become available. These terms may also be mapped to controlled vocabulary standards such as ISO 3166.</sm:fileAbstract>
