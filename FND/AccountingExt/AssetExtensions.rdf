		<skos:definition xml:lang="en">Some asset which is or may be measured monearality in some currency. Editorial Note: This class introduced because the original FIBO model has a property &quot;measured in&quot; (with range of Currency) which is not in FIBO-FND v1.0 and because this lets us use the parent class to define anything as an asset if it is owned whether or not it is measured monetarily. Applications of the concept of Asset to accouting, book-keeping etc where it is measured should use this now term in place of the parent term &quot;Asset&quot;. Note also that the moved property &quot;measured in&quot; is an object property, having a range of Currency.</skos:definition>
