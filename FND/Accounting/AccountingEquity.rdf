		<rdfs:label>Accounting Equity Ontology</rdfs:label>
		<dct:abstract>This ontology defines equity-related concepts for use in defining other FIBO ontology elements. These are based on basic accounting principles as they relate to equity, debt, assets and liabilities of a firm. Equity forms the basis for ownership of certain forms of corporate body.</dct:abstract>

		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Accounting/AccountingEquity.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.</skos:changeNote>
