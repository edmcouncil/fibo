		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20130801/OwnershipAndControl/Ownership.rdf version of the ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.0 FTF report and in http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/1.0/AboutFND-1.0/.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20180801/OwnershipAndControl/Ownership.rdf version of the ontology was modified to revise the definition of Asset using the new CombinedDateTime datatype rather than xsd:dateTime to provide increased flexibility.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/OwnershipAndControl/Ownership.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
	(1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
	(2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
	(3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
	(4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
	(5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20190401/OwnershipAndControl/Ownership.rdf version of the ontology was modified to add definitions for tangible and intangible asset, etc., as needed for refinement of the concept of collateral and other loan-specific concepts.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20200101/OwnershipAndControl/Ownership.rdf version of the ontology was modified to integrate the concept of a situation, situational roles, and corresponding relations with the definition of ownership, and eliminate minimum cardinality of 1 in restrictions.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20200601/OwnershipAndControl/Ownership.rdf version of the ontology was modified to reflect the move of hasAquisitionDate from relations to financial dates and eliminate circular definitions.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20200701/OwnershipAndControl/Ownership.rdf version of the ontology was modified to better align with revisions to the situation lattice.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20210401/OwnershipAndControl/Ownership.rdf version of the ontology was modified to address hygiene issues with respect to text formatting.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20220701/OwnershipAndControl/Ownership.rdf version of the ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) Annotation Vocabulary rather than the OMG&apos;s Specification Metadata vocabulary.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20230101/OwnershipAndControl/Ownership.rdf version of this ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) rather than the OMG&apos;s Languages, Countries and Codes (LCC), eliminating redundancies in FIBO as appropriate.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20230301/OwnershipAndControl/Ownership.rdf version of this ontology was modified to replace content that is now available in the OMG Commons Ontology Library (Commons) v1.1 (FND-380).</skos:changeNote>

		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>An asset is something that provides probable future economic benefit obtained or controlled by some party as a result of past transactions or events. An asset has three essential characteristics: (a) it embodies a probable future benefit that involves a capacity, singly or in combination with other assets, to contribute directly or indirectly to future net cash inflows, (b) a party can obtain the benefit and control others&apos; access to it, and (c) the transaction or other event giving rise to the party&apos;s right to or control of the benefit has already occurred.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

Intangible assets have become an increasingly larger component of the valuation for all companies, from newer social media companies to even the most established and iconic manufacturers.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
