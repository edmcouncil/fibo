		<rdfs:label>Legal Core Ontology</rdfs:label>
		<dct:abstract>This ontology defines high-level legal concepts for use in other FIBO ontology elements. These concepts include law and constitution, both of which are framed at a more abstract level than national or state laws and constitutions, so that law forms the basis both for statutes and for company by-laws, and constitution forms the basis both for national or state constitutions and for instruments which are constitutive of incorporated legal entities. This ontology also defines some of the variants of these such as governmental constitutions and ordinances. Court of Law is also defined here.</dct:abstract>

		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20130801/Law/LegalCore.rdf version of the ontology was was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.0 FTF report and in http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/1.0/AboutFND-1.0/.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20141101/Law/LegalCore.rdf version of the ontology was was modified per the FIBO 2.0 RFC.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Law/LegalCore.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
	(1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
	(2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
	(3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
	(4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
	(5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.
	(6) to revise some of the text definitions using more formal sources.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20180801/Law/LegalCore.rdf version of the ontology was revised to correct the camel case name of hasInForce (was hasInforce).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20200501/Law/LegalCore.rdf version of the ontology was revised to eliminate circular and ambiguous definitions, and simplify the ontology by eliminating unused concepts, including GovernmentalConstitution, Ordinance and narrowly defined and unused properties - constrains and isConstrainedBy.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20210101/Law/LegalCore.rdf version of the ontology was revised to address hygiene issues with respect to text formatting.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20220701/Law/LegalCore.rdf version of the ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) Annotation Vocabulary rather than the OMG&apos;s Specification Metadata vocabulary.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20230101/Law/LegalCore.rdf version of this ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) rather than the OMG&apos;s Languages, Countries and Codes (LCC), eliminating redundancies in FIBO as appropriate.</skos:changeNote>
