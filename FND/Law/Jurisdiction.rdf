		<rdfs:label>Jurisdiction Ontology</rdfs:label>
		<dct:abstract>This ontology defines high level concepts relating to jurisdictions for use in other FIBO ontology elements. This includes a general definition of jurisdiction along with some basic types of jurisdiction, along with the factors which distinguish one type of jurisdiction from another. This ontology also defines basic types of legal system, and extends the basic concept of law which is in the LegalCore ontology..</dct:abstract>

		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20130801/Law/Jurisdiction.rdf version of the ontology was was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.0 FTF report and in http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/1.0/AboutFND-1.0/.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20141101/Law/Jurisdiction.rdf version of the ontology was was modified per the FIBO 2.0 RFC to integrate LCC.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Law/Jurisdiction.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations
   (6) to revise definitions using more formal sources.</skos:changeNote>

		<rdfs:label>common law system</rdfs:label>
		<skos:definition>common law, also known as case law or precedent, is law developed by judges through decisions of courts and similar tribunals</skos:definition>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:definitionOrigin rdf:datatype="&xsd;anyURI">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law</fibo-fnd-utl-av:definitionOrigin>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>A jurisdiction which is based in Common Law will also have alongside a legislature that passes statutes.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>By contrast, civil law (codified/continental law) is set on statutes adopted through the legislative/parliamentary process and/or regulations issued by the executive branch on base of the parliamentary statutes.

A common law system is a legal system that gives great potential precedential weight to common law, on the principle that it is unfair to treat similar facts differently on different occasions. The body of precedent is called common law and it binds future decisions. In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (this principle is known as stare decisis). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a matter of first impression), judges have the authority and duty to make law by creating precedent. Thereafter, the new decision becomes precedent, and will bind future courts.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
