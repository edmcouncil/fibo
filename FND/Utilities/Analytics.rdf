		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>Standard deviation applied to the annual rate of return of an investment provides insights on the historical volatility of that investment. The greater the standard deviation of the price of a security, the greater the volatility.

		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>While the arithmetic mean is often used to report central tendencies, it is not a robust statistic, meaning that it is greatly influenced by outliers (values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values). Notably, for skewed distributions, such as the distribution of income for which a few people&apos;s incomes are substantially greater than most people&apos;s, the arithmetic mean may not accord with one&apos;s notion of &apos;middle&apos;, and robust statistics, such as the median, may be a better description of central tendency.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>A measure of statistical dispersion is a nonnegative real number that is zero if all the data are the same and increases as the data become more diverse.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>It is usually measured as an average deviation about some central value (e.g. mean deviation, standard deviation) or by an order statistic (e.g. quartile deviation, range) but may also be a mean of deviations of values among themselves (e.g. Gini&apos;s mean difference and also standard deviation).</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

		<skos:definition>mean that indicates the central tendency or typical value of a set of numbers by using the product of their values (as opposed to the arithmetic mean which uses their sum)</skos:definition>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>The geometric mean is defined as the nth root of the product of n numbers. A geometric mean is often used when comparing different items - finding a single &apos;figure of merit&apos; for these items - when each item has multiple properties that have different numeric ranges. For example, the geometric mean can give a meaningful &apos;average&apos; to compare two companies which are each rated at 0 to 5 for their environmental sustainability, and are rated at 0 to 100 for their financial viability. If an arithmetic mean were used instead of a geometric mean, the financial viability is given more weight because its numeric range is larger - so a small percentage change in the financial rating (e.g. going from 80 to 90) makes a much larger difference in the arithmetic mean than a large percentage change in environmental sustainability (e.g. going from 2 to 5).</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
