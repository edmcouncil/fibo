		<sm:fileAbstract>This ontology defines the concepts of legitimate and illicit organizations for use in other FIBO ontology elements. These distinctions are provided in order to facilitate modeling of concepts relevant to money laundering. Legitimate organizations such as clubs are defined. These, along with the distinctions of formal versus informal organizations, provide the universe of possible kinds of organizations which may perform specific roles such as holding shares, having control of assets of companies and so on.</sm:fileAbstract>

		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Organizations/LegitimateOrganizations.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/FND/20130801/Organizations/LegitimateOrganizations.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.0 FTF report and in http://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/FND/1.0/AboutFND-1.0/.</skos:changeNote>

		<skos:definition>A kind of organization which has been set up specifically to perform illegal acts or has become such</skos:definition>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>This is not to do with performing illicit acts.

We can narrow down on a definition for Illicit Organization - one which has been set up specifically to perform illicit acts or has become such. This relates to the purpose of the organization, and the purposes of the entities which control that entity. And the acts which the entity may perform. 

(definition adopted from the above note, with Illicit changed to Illegal for clarity). 

Typically, a money laundering entity may perform (will perform) legal acts and is explicitly set up for such, but will also perform illicit acts. 

The definition of illicit is framed entirely with respect to law and not morality.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
