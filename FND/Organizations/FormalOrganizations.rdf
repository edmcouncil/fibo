		<rdfs:label>Formal Organizations Ontology</rdfs:label>
		<dct:abstract>This ontology defines the high level concept of formal organization for use in other FIBO ontology elements.  It is purposefully underspecified to facilitate mapping to other formal organization ontologies, such as the emerging W3C formal organization ontology, or others defined for specific business and financial services standards. The concepts in this ontology extend those in the Organizations ontology.</dct:abstract>

		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20130801/Organizations/FormalOrganizations.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.0 FTF report and in http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/1.0/AboutFND-1.0/. It was further revised in the FTF in advance of the Long Beach meeting, resulting in http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20141101/Organizations/FormalOrganizations/.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20141101/Organizations/FormalOrganizations.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the FIBO 2.0 RFC to integrate concepts from LCC.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Organizations/FormalOrganizations.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.</skos:changeNote>
