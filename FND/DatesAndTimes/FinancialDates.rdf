		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20141101/DatesAndTimes/FinancialDates/ version of this ontology was revised by the FIBO FND 1.2 RTF in order to introduce the definition of a time interval, which is a location, to ground some of the concepts such as a date period, and duration as well as to support the definition of business recurrence intervals for use in parametric schedules for securities.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20170201/DatesAndTimes/FinancialDates/ version of this ontology was revised by the FIBO 2.0 RFC in order to introduce the definition of a time instant, to eliminate a reasoning issue with relative dates, and remove a circular dependency inadvertently incorporated in the ontology with a FIBO FND 1.2 modification.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20180801/DatesAndTimes/FinancialDates/ version of this ontology was revised to introduce a composite date datatype to allow for cases whereby the representation of a date for certain purposes, such as GLEIF LEI data, is inconsistent, and to facilitate mapping FIBO to multiple data sources in user environments.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20190201/DatesAndTimes/FinancialDates/ version of this ontology was revised to eliminate deprecated elements.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20200201/DatesAndTimes/FinancialDates/ version of this ontology was revised to add the &apos;has date added&apos; property, which is needed for the date a constituent is added to a basket, among other purposes, to add a TimeOfDay class, needed for representing rate reset times, eliminate duplication with concepts in LCC, and make AdHocScheduleEntry a child of DatedCollectionConstituent.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20200301/DatesAndTimes/FinancialDates/ version of this ontology was revised to move dated collection and dated collection constituent as well as hasObservedDateTime and hasAcquisitionDate to financial dates in order to improve usability, simplify reasoning, made definitions ISO 704 compliant, and eliminate redundant restrictions on ad hoc schedule entry.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20200701/DatesAndTimes/FinancialDates/ version of this ontology was revised to add hasOpeningDateTime and hasClosingDateTime for use in defining trading days and sessions and eliminated the functional property declaration on hasExplicitDate.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20201201/DatesAndTimes/FinancialDates/ version of this ontology was revised to add the concept of age and a corresponding property that supports its use.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20210601/DatesAndTimes/FinancialDates.rdf version of this ontology was modified to add notes on the custom CombinedDateTime datatype indicating that it is outside the RL profile and that if someone wants to use this ontology with OWL 2 RL rules they might want to comment this out / eliminate it where it is used.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20210901/DatesAndTimes/FinancialDates.rdf version of this ontology was modified to remove a functional declaration on hasObservedDateTime, which causes reasoning inconsistencies when there are multiple uses of that property for certain individuals, such as for LEI registration.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20211201/DatesAndTimes/FinancialDates.rdf version of this ontology was modified to address hygiene issues with respect to text formatting.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>This ontology was added to Foundations in advance of the December 2014 Long Beach meeting in support of the SEC specification. It is also needed to provide temporal relationships for Ownership and Control.

These three ontologies are designed for use together:

	* FinancialDates -- financial Dates and Schedules
	* BusinessDates -- business day adjustments
	* Occurrences -- occurrences (events) and kinds of occurrences

They are modularized this way to minimize the ontological committments that are imposed upon ontologies that rely upon them. Ontologies can import FinancialDates alone, or FinancialDates + BusinessDates, or FinancialDates + Occurrences, or all three together.</skos:changeNote>

In particular, the Occurrences ontology extends AdHocScheduleEntry to consist of occurrences (events) of a given OccurrenceKind. The meaning is that an ad hoc schedule entry comprises a date and an event which is scheduled to occur on that date.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:usageNote>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:usageNote>The Date of an AdHocScheduleEntry can be an ExplicitDate or any kind of CalculatedDate, such as:

* An OccurrenceBasedDate -- a Date that itself is defined by an Occurrence (see the Occurrences ontology)
* A RelativeDate - a Date relative to another Date, such as T+3
* A SpecifiedDate - a Date that is defined by an arbitrary rule</fibo-fnd-utl-av:usageNote>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:usageNote>The fibo-fnd-dt-fd;hasDate property may be used to reify a date, if it is important to do so for a given application, or if not and typically, the inherited fibo-fnd-dt-fd;hasObservedDateTime property may be used together with a fibo-fnd-dt-fd;CombinedDateTime value, as long as the resulting schedule is consistent in using one or the other.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:usageNote>

For example, a calendar year always starts on a January 1 and ends on a December 31.

For example, a calendar year never starts on September 1.

Similar points apply to other kinds of calendar periods, such as calendar week, calendar month, and calendar quarter.</skos:editorialNote>

		<skos:editorialNote>The BusinessDates ontology extends &apos;RegularSchedule&apos; with an optional BusinessDayAdjustment that specifies what should happen if a scheduled date falls on a weekend or a holiday.</skos:editorialNote>
		<skos:example>A 30 year mortgage is payable monthly on the 10th of the month, starting July 2015. The mortgage is issued on June 15, 2015 so the first payment is for the period June 15-June 30, and the last payment is for June 1-14 2045.

The payment schedule is a RegularSchedule with these properties:

* comprises: regular payment OccurrenceKind (with payment details) (see the &apos;comprises&apos; property of the Occurrences ontology)
* hasInitialStub: June 15-30, 2015 for initial payment
* hasFinalStub: June 1-14, 2045 for final payment
* hasCount: 358
* hasOverallPeriod starting Date: June 15, 2015 with a duration of 30 years
* hasRecurrenceInterval: specifies 10th day of each calendar month
* hasRecurrenceStartDate: July 1, 2015</skos:example>
		<skos:example>A corporate bond pays interest for 10 years starting on the first day of 2015. Interest payments are due 15 days after the expiration of each 6 month period: on July 15 and January 16.

The payment schedule is a RegularSchedule, with these properties:

* comprises: identifies the interest payment details
* overall DatePeriod starting date is &apos;2015-01-01&apos;, ending date is &apos;2025-01-15&apos;, and duration is &apos;P10Y15D&apos;
* hasCount is 20 (2 payments per year for 10 years)
* hasRecurrenceInterval is &apos;P6M&apos;
* hasRecurrenceStartDate is &apos;2015-01-15&apos;</skos:example>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>A RegularSchedule is a Schedule defined as a set of Dates that start on a recurrence start date and repeat after each recurrence interval. The size of this set is defined by a count.

The &apos;initial ScheduleStub&apos; associated with a RegularSchedule identifies any special treatment applied before the recurrence start date. Similarly, a &apos;final ScheduleStub&apos; identifies any special handling at the end of the recurrences. For example, a mortgage loan that is due each calendar month may have an initial payment due before the first calendar month, or a final payment due after the last monthly payment.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:usageNote>Other ontologies can extend RegularSchedule as needed.

In particular, the Occurrences ontology extends RegularSchedule to &apos;comprise&apos; an &apos;OccurrenceKind&apos;. The intended meaning is that a regular schedule comprises a number of scheduled dates and an event which is scheduled to occur on each of those dates, in other words an Occurrence of the OccurrenceKind should happen on each Date defined by the RegularSchedule.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:usageNote>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:usageNote>The recurrence start date can be an ExplicitDate or any kind of CalculatedDate. Hence, the starting date could be relative to another Date (e.g. T+3) or triggered by the Occurrence of an OccurrenceKind, etc.

The recurrence start date can also be relative to the starting Date of the overall DatePeriod of the Schedule.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:usageNote>
