Further notes: Some kinds of collection are defined in terms of collections of relative things (e.g. basket constituents) with qualifying facts, while others may be defined simply as sets of independent things. It is also possible to have a collection of collections. This is covered by the identity criterion for the Constituent being any Independent Thing, including Collection.</skos:definition>
