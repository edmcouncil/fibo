		<skos:definition
			xml:lang="en">Some named physical location on Earth, identified geographically such as a specific land area, city or geographical feature. Scope Note: This is usually an alternative way of describing some geophysical extent or location, for example describing a city as a city as distinct from describing the physical extent of that city. Many concepts may therefore extend from this and from Geophysical or Geospatial concepts. For many purposes, modelers may ignore this class. Scope Note: This differs from Geophysical Location in that may include geographical features identified as points on the Earth&apos;s surface, or as linear features such as rivers and shorelines.</skos:definition>

Explanatory Note: Some of these locations may also be co-extensive with Geographical Features, the latter being named geophysical lications.</skos:definition>
