		<rdfs:label>Contracts Ontology</rdfs:label>
		<dct:abstract>This ontology defines the concept of contract and roles that parties to contract play in the context of financial agreements. Coverage includes written contracts which are the concrete evidence of agreements between parties and verbal contracts. Contracts are further broken down into bilateral and transferable contracts, the latter being the basis for most financial instruments, and basic properties of contracts, such as terms and conditions, are also covered.</dct:abstract>

		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Agreements/Contracts.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
		(1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
		(2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
		(3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
		(4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
		(5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20130801/Agreements/Contracts.rdf version of the ontology was was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.0 FTF report and in https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/1.0/AboutFND-1.0/.</skos:changeNote>

		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20201201/Agreements/Contracts.rdf version of this ontology was revised to eliminate references to external dictionary sites that no longer resolve, move the concept of an extension provision from Debt to Contracts to support representation of preferred shares and other extendable contracts, added a property for contract duration which is needed for long-term options, moved PromissoryNote to Debt for better integration with related concepts, and integrated additional contractual elements, including representations, warranties, and termination provision.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20210301/Agreements/Contracts.rdf version of this ontology was revised to clean up the definition of transferable contract, including eliminating an unnecessary equivalence, adding subclasses for assignable and novatable contracts, and to restrictions from contract to written contract that did not make sense with respect to a verbal contract.</skos:changeNote>

		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>Note that while the assignor may divest themselves of some rights, that assignment does not necessarily eliminate performance obligations of the assignor to the third party.

		<skos:definition>contract that may be replaced by another contract, and in that event, extinguishes the rights and obligations in effect under the original contract with those in the new agreement</skos:definition>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>In general, novation means consensual substitution of a party or obligation in the original contract with a new party or obligation in the successor contract. The new party takes on the rights and obligations of the original party. The corresponding novation agreement must be signed by the transferor, the transferee, and the counterparty (the other contracting party). Novation is frequently used in mergers and acquisitions to replace any outstanding relationships or rights and obligations of the organization being subsumed with relationships or obligations of the acquiring entity. It is also commonly used with respect to loan rescheduling.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>Novation is different from assignment in the following ways: (1) novation is a consensual transfer of contractual rights and obligations, while an assignment can transfer only obligations and does not require the consent of the benefiting party, and (2) novation terminates the original contract, but assignment does not.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
