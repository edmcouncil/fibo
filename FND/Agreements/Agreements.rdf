		<sm:fileAbstract>This ontology defines concepts for agreements, for use in other ontology elements. Agreements as defined here are the actual agreements between parties, and this ontology is intended to be referred to in conjunction with the contracts ontology which defines the actual contracts which formalize such agreements. The concepts of agreement and contract are intended to be kept distinct in the FIBO ontologies, that is neither is intended to be regarded as a sub type of the other.</sm:fileAbstract>

		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Agreements/Agreements.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.
   (6) to revise a few of the definitions based on more formal sources.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/FND/20130801/Agreements/Agreement.rdf version of the ontology was was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.0 FTF report and in http://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/FND/1.0/AboutFND-1.0/.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/FND/20141101/Agreements/Agreement.rdf version of the ontology was was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.1 RTF report and in http://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/FND/1.1/AboutFND-1.1/.</skos:changeNote>

		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>Although a binding contract can (and often does) result from an agreement, an agreement typically documents the give-and-take of a negotiated settlement and a contract specifies the minimum acceptable standard of performance.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>An agreement may be formalized in the form of a Contract or other formal instrument, or it may not. In either case, the agreement is that which may be referred to as the agreement between or among the parties, and the contract is framed as defining (and usually as exclusively defining) the agreement between two parties.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>An agreement provides language that defines the terms and conditions of a legally binding contract among the identified parties, ordinarily leading to a contract.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

		<rdfs:label>commitment</rdfs:label>
		<skos:definition>A legal construct which represents the undertaking on the part of some party to act or refrain from acting in some manner.</skos:definition>
		<skos:editorialNote>The undertaking by some party to act or refrain from acting results in an obligation on the part of that party, and usually results in the existence of some corresponding right on the party of some other party, in the event that the commitment is to such party. Thus Obligations and Rights are considered as reciprocal aspects of this Commitment concept.</skos:editorialNote>
