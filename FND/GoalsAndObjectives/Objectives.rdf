		<rdfs:label>Objectives Ontology</rdfs:label>
		<dct:abstract>This ontology defines the concept of an objective, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. Objectives are defined as being distinct from goals, in that they constitute time limited and measurable targets which some entity may seek to attain in pursuit  of its goals.</dct:abstract>

		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/GoalsAndObjectives/Objectives.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations
   (6) to eliminate an unnecessary hasObjectives property and related imports dependencies.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20130801/GoalsAndObjectives/Objectives.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.0 FTF report and in https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/1.0/AboutFND-1.0/.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20180801/GoalsAndObjectives/Objectives.rdf version of this ontology was modified to integrate concepts such as investment objective, business objective, strategy, and related properties.</skos:changeNote>

		<rdfs:label>business objective</rdfs:label>
		<skos:definition>objective that reflects the strategic goals and direction of a business within a time frame and available resources</skos:definition>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>Business objectives allow an organization to define its goals and direction. A company uses strategy and tactics at every level of its operation to achieve its objectives. These define the way a company allocates its resources and the strengths, weaknesses and opportunities it may have. Companies usually do not alter their objectives once they are implemented, unless changes in circumstances arise. Setting a clear course for the organization is key to its success.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>In general, objectives are more specific and easier to measure than goals. Objectives are basic tools that underlie all planning and strategic activities. They serve as the basis for creating policy and evaluating performance. Some examples of business objectives include minimizing expenses, expanding internationally, or making a profit.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
