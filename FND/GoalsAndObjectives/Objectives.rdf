		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/GoalsAndObjectives/Objectives.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
	(1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
	(2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
	(3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
	(4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
	(5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations
	(6) to eliminate an unnecessary hasObjectives property and related imports dependencies.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20130801/GoalsAndObjectives/Objectives.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.0 FTF report and in https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/1.0/AboutFND-1.0/.</skos:changeNote>

		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>Business aims are sometimes considered broad, long-term goals, and in such cases, the term &apos;aim&apos; is used interchangeably with goal. Here, however we differentiate between qualitative goals and quantitative objectives, both of which are kinds of aims, with the critical differences including measurability and time frame. Goals tend to have a much longer trajectory, provide the basis for determining objectives, and are often aligned with an organization&apos;s mission, whereas objectives are short term and measurable.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

		<rdfs:label>business objective</rdfs:label>
		<skos:definition>objective that reflects the strategic goals and direction of a business within a time frame and available resources</skos:definition>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>Business objectives allow an organization to define its goals and direction. A company uses strategy and tactics at every level of its operation to achieve its objectives. These define the way a company allocates its resources and the strengths, weaknesses and opportunities it may have. Companies usually do not alter their objectives once they are implemented, unless changes in circumstances arise. Setting a clear course for the organization is key to its success.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>In general, objectives are more specific and easier to measure than goals. Objectives are basic tools that underlie all planning and strategic activities. They serve as the basis for creating policy and evaluating performance. Some examples of business objectives include minimizing expenses, expanding internationally, or making a profit.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">A strategy is a high-level plan or approach designed to achieve a long-term goal or outcome, often by choosing among different possible methods or courses of action. A strategy may involve activities that are needed in order to achieve specific goals or objectives. It may take into account one or more policies or any number of restrictions and constraints. Strategies are typically distinguished by long-term orientation, adaptive planning, and broad scope.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">Studies involve exploration, analysis, sometimes modeling, and sometimes evaluation, but are not necessarily focused on evaluation and may or may not be criteria-based, which distinguishes it from the concept of an assessment. In a business context, a study might map capabilities, analyze value streams, or model information flows. Only some studies produce an assessment (e.g., capability maturity assessment). A clinical research study may observe, test, or model phenomena, and may or may not result in a clinical or risk assessment. A study conducted as part of a project or larger programme may explore feasibility, options, impacts, or requirements.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
