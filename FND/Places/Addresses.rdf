		<rdfs:label>Addresses Ontology</rdfs:label>
		<dct:abstract>This ontology provides a very high level definition of address, essentially a placeholder for use in mapping addresses to the appropriate regional standards or to some as yet undefined global address ontology, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. A minimal set of address related terms are included as required for financial risk management and other application use cases, and these are all to be considered as placeholders for suitable global address standards as these become available.</dct:abstract>

		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20141101/Places/Addresses.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.1 RTF report. Differences from the 1.0 version include the addition of a hasAddress property and PhysicalAddress class as a parent of PostalAddress.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20160201/Places/Addresses.rdf version of this ontology was modified for the FIBO 2.0 RFC to integrate LCC.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20130801/Places/Addresses.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.0 FTF report and in https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/1.0/AboutFND-1.0/. Primary differences include elimination of data properties in favor of a simple class model,the addition of virtual address, and the addition of addressing scheme.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/Foundations/20130601/Organizations/Addresses.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations
   (6) to move this ontology from Organizations to Places and eliminate unnecessary properties and related imports dependencies.</skos:changeNote>
