		<rdfs:label>Countries Ontology</rdfs:label>
		<dct:abstract>This ontology provides a very high level definition of country related concepts, essentially a placeholder for use in mapping countries and intra-country concepts to the appropriate regional standards or to some as yet undefined global address ontology, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. A minimal set of geopolitical and geophysical terms are included as required for financial risk management and other application use cases, and these are all to be considered as placeholders for suitable standard ontologies for these concepts as these become available. These terms may also be mapped to controlled vocabulary standards such as ISO 3166.</dct:abstract>

		<skos:scopeNote>This model includes representation of the capital administrative region of those federations for which the capital is situated other than within one of the states or provinces which make up the country as a whole. This is so that addresses and other references which may need to refer to any location within the country may do so. Examples include the District of Columbia in the US, and the Canberra area in Australia. Not all federations have such an area.</skos:scopeNote>

		<skos:example>A municipality can be any political jurisdiction from a sovereign state, such as the Principality of Monaco, or a small village, such as West Hampton Dunes, New York.</skos:example>
		<skos:scopeNote>The territory over which a municipality has jurisdiction may encompass:
- only one populated place such as a city, town, or village
- several of such places (e.g., early jurisdictions in the state of New Jersey (1798-1899) as townships governing several villages, Municipalities of Mexico)
- only parts of such places, sometimes boroughs of a city such as the 34 municipalities of Santiago, Chile.</skos:scopeNote>
