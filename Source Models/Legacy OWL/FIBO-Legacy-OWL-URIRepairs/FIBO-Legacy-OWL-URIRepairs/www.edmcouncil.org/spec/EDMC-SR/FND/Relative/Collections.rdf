      <skos:definition>A constituent of the Collection, that is one of the things that is collected up in bring the collection into being. Further notes: Some kinds of collection are defined in terms of collections of relative things (e.g. basket constituents) with qualifying facts, while others may be defined simply as sets of independent things. It is also possible to have a collection of collections. This is covered by the identity criterion for the Constituent being any Independent Thing, including Collection.</skos:definition>

      <skos:definition>Something which makes up part of a collection, formalized in terms of its existence as a member of that collection.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>The collection may be of almost anything, brought together in some specific context in which the Constituent is defined as such. It differs from a less formal collection in that there are facts defined about the constituents and the proportions of these in the collection, and specific facts about that item as a member of that collection. Constituents are defined for Pools and for Baskets.</skos:editorialNote>
