      <rdfs:label>Sovereign</rdfs:label>
      <skos:definition>The legal person corresponding to a state or country.</skos:definition>
      <skos:editorialNote>This has a Government which sets laws in one or more (usually one) legal jurisdictions. It is identified as a legal entity as well as the setter of laws because it is able to incur debt in its own right. Additional review notes: A State is usually identified in the 'Person' of some sovereign, where such sovereign may be a member of a royal family, or in the case of a Republic, the People. It is this 'Person' which is named in legal documents and court proceedings in which the State is a respondent, or in the assertion of legal rights, for example 'The People versus XYZ' or 'Crown Copyright'. Such a person may embody more than one State and would not usually be identified as an individual human being. In some cases, such a State forms part of a Federation along with other such states.</skos:editorialNote>
