		<dct:abstract>This ontology is a companion to the Secured Loans ontology, and defines loans for which there is no security, either as guaranty or as collateral. 
		Note that for most applications this ontology would not be needed. It is provided in order to provide a conceptually complete account of the kinds of loans there might be. While most people would not lend on this basis, the concept still exists.</dct:abstract>
