Corporate can be &quot;resident&quot; in a location. can be regarded sa resident for tax purposes, which seems to be the thing we refer to as &quot;Registration&quot; (new term added today for Incorporated Company). So we have for example the Registered Address determines your residency? In the US most companies are incorporeated in Delaware because they have more lenient requirements. Place of Incorporation is usually their &quot;Place of REsidence&quot; but they may register in various states for various reasons, and in other foreign countries (except where this is a separate leagel entity presumably? MB). So: Is &quot;Resident&quot; the term we generally use for all legal entities or only for natural persons? Domicile is a better word, and is used in the context of corporations as well as natural persons. Examples: in Aus, someone nameless may have changed their place of residence due to issues around aspextos. Similar casinos incorporated in obscure countries.</skos:definition>
