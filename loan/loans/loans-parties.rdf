        <skos:definition>The party which is the Loan Servicer. Further notes: The Loan Servicer may be the original lender or it may be someone else. For instance, if the bank is sold by Bank A, it may be given to some third party for servicing. Servicing is either done by the original lender or by someone else. Idea: Look at a data model from one of the main agencies. See Fannie Mae enterprise common data model. In progress. More precise definition needed for what it is to service a loan, i.e. what activities this party participates in and what facts apply. Some of these are defined in the facts which are emerging from these reviews. There seem to be several functions which may or may not be combined.</skos:definition>
