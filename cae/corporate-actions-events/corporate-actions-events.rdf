Such choices would include: - Currency - Pay in Kind (&quot;Spinoff&quot; or PiK - see PiK corporate Action) Could be mandatory. If there were an option then the letter announcing it would require a response. This is usually stated in the message. Is there a message even if there is no option? Yes. Usually have to generate the events artificially as the Servicing organization. you can&apos;t rely on a feed or message coming in but becaues it is part o fthe security contract the aove has to generate at the expected time, and arrange the payments. Q: That is the point at there was a choice you would expect to see a message, or end up still having to generate it but with the choices. A: The ones with Choices come as announcements and don&apos;t ave to be generated by the Service. Older definitin (re-scoped now: An Event in which a payment occurs. Anything can have a payment event. If a thing hits a pay date, whether it&apos;s voluntary or mandatory, that&apos;s a payment event. Divide into: Securities Cash Combination Payment or Distribution? Are these exclusive? Take an event that&apos;s always a combination of options, and an option is a combination of payouts. Generates transactions - determine what txns happen when a customer chooses that option. Distribution / delivery: generic concept Payment - implis cash distribution. So payment is specialization of distribution.</skos:definition>

Current holders of the targeted security are invited (and given a message by the issuer) to make an offer in which they would be willling to sell their holdings. OR It might also represent a separate scenario where third parties do this, as per the original SWIFT defition. You can only go to the Registrar which would the other scenario impossible. Agents and Registrars: The issue issuer os the company which issued the shares (as modeled); Most companies don&apos;t interact directly with the market to find out who they need to disseminate the info to. They can, but more likely the employ &quot;Issuers Agent&quot;. That provides one point of contact from the organization. That agent handles all coms with the Registrars, and to the news wires etc., to disseminate the corporate action. Context: CAE only, or in the context of the Issue? When you issue the security you nominate an Agent, in the prospectus, there is specified an Issuing Agent. This is the one that does these things. Usually a merchant bank etc. in the old days. This is who will have directly facilitated that direct market engagement. Next question: This is part of going public, so these agents are appointed as part of going public.</skos:definition>

There could be several events which could be considered as Capitalization Issues. 25 May Later research: Scrip or Bonus issue is seen to be synonymous with this but more accurate. However, we question this - if you have the chance to purchase shares at a particular price (which is a right) would extend the definition of .. 20 July: this could have a broader meaning than Capital reserves Distribution It would include distribution of capital and trying to raise capital by additional capital injection Example: If the company issues bonds, that also changes the capital base. Now to change the capital base, there are two directions, up or down. Bonus issue falls into the above because you are increasing the capital base. A rights issue also increateses the capital base. Distributions of capital has the opposite effect. Paying out cash to reduce those items that are in your reserves. the reserves are greater than you need so you pay out cash on those. Labeling: capitalization implies the creation of capital so only suggests an increase the capital base</skos:definition>

The CA notificaiton may be setting out the rules on each tax reclaim. Example: Aus: Issuer may make declaration to tax department, that securities are widely issued, this has some effect on withholding etc. Countries may have standing rules fo rreclaims, but may be special rules at an issue action level for large issue action. this would go out as a message (notification) using this message code. Similar to VAT in Canada - as an individual you pay VAT and reclaim it when you leave the country. Fill out a form etc. Then they send the VAT back.
