        <rdfs:label>eurodollar deposit</rdfs:label>
        <skos:definition>A US dollar deposit or other currency deposit made outside the US or the country that issues that currency. Further notes from riskglossary.com (part of Money Market Deposit article): The Eurodollar market has become global, so its name is a bit of a misnomer. A bank in Japan or Singapore may accept dollar deposits, but these are still called Eurodollar deposits. The market also includes other currencies, so there are Eurosterling, Euroyen, Euroswiss, etc. To confuse matters, in 1999, the European Union embraced the euro as its new currency, so you can now hear of Euroeuro. Eurocurrency is the general term for any currency deposited in bank branches outside countries where it is the national currency. Comment: Should this not rather be labeled as Eurocurrency Deposit, corresponding with the above definition? Eurodollar deposit would be a dollar-denominated sub type of this.</skos:definition>
